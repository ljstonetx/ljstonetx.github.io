<br><br><p1>The El Fuste Structure remains intact today, located in the area now known as the Mercedes Waterfall. However, the name 'Fuste' has faded from both the local lexicon and newspapers, and the surrounding area is no longer referred to as Fusteâ€”it has essentially been lost to time. The following Google Maps image shows what seem to be the four pipes that make up the El Fuste Syphon. These four pipes are located on the left side of the image, with Baseline Road to the north and the Mercedes Waterfalls visible on the right.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>This postcard depicts a crowd watching a cockfight in the rough and tumble community of Rio Rico south of Mercedes. Rio Rico was originally located north of the Rio Grande River on land surrounded by a bend in the river. In July 1906 the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built a cutoff to direct the river into a more direct course. As a result RÃ­o Rico came to be located south of the border in Mexico. No longer clearly part of either the United States or Mexico RÃ­o Rico became a lawless territory where gambling dance halls and saloons flourished. The Tivoli named after a renowned nightclub in Italy was the first and most well-known nightclub. [43] [75] [94]</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>G. G. Garcia recalls: The late Baptist Reverend W. Sumerlin daily excoriated Colegio for being a hotbed for Chicano activists.  -- Communists - was the term he used to describe them.  As a conservative Republican I was anathema to the ultra-liberal ideologues of the college.

The speaking engagement would be confrontational. Like Daniel I was walking into the lions den.They would not attack the incumbent Texas State Senator Jim Bates a Democrat. He was too glib in both languages. State Representative Raul Longoria also a democrat hardly ever showed his face during the campaign. He was using the phantom strategy - You cannot attack what you dont see. Ricardo Molina the third party candidate was running on the Raza Unida ticket. He was one of them.  So I was it. I took them on one against many. I walked out feeling I had earned their respect.</p1><br><br>

Note the pistol in the back pocket of the 2nd man from the left in the rign. Rio Rico was originally located north of the Rio Grande River on land surrounded by a bend in the river. In July 1906, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built a cutoff to direct the river into a more direct course. As a result, Río Rico came to be located south of the border in Mexico. No longer clearly part of either the United States or Mexico, Río Rico became a lawless territory where gambling, dance halls, and saloons flourished.  The Tivoli, named after a renowned nightclub in Italy, was the first and most well-known nightclub.

The good work of the soldiers saved nearby buildings from almost any damage. If American soldiers can fight Huns as good as they can fight fires there will undoutably be an early end to the war...The origin of the fire is a mystery, but it was  probably from a cigarette that found its way under the stage.'

The first city election installed the six council members. They are, left to right: John Puckett, Gouverneur K Watson, Mayor William Lingenbrink, Dr. Edward Schoonmaker, Fred Cutting, and Lyle Harrison. [27]

This postcard shows the new city council members sitting in Mercedes City Park smoking their cigars. All members are similarly dressed in the style of the day - jacket, vest and bowtie, heads topped by a bowler style hat.  For footwear, they wear knee high laced leather boots,  a necessity on the dusty, unpaved Mercedes roads.  Look closely to see the pistol at the feet of the council member on the far left.

Some are reading books and newspapers. The inscription states  'Dearest Adeline, These are the members of the week-end tent party taken in the yard in front of the tent. The two young ladies in white standing were the hostesses. Miss Page is sitting next to me then Miss Lastinger and Miss Evins. Miss Hodges has on the cap and Miss Gladys Lastinger is back of them. So now you will know more of Mercedes people. Worlds of love. Aunt Eleanor'.

It is not clear what a tent party was in that era. Perhaps it was a garden party, or perhaps a party in one of the tents early Mercedes residents lived in since few hotels or houses were available.  Note the white dresses and blouses which must have been difficult to keep clean in the living conditions of early Mercedes.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/R048.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5465/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/U022.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">U022 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Hurricane of 1909 Puts Mercedes under 14 Feet of Water </strong></font><font color="#414141">1909 </font><br><br><p1>This postcard shows flooded homes near the newly founded town of Mercedes after the Hurricane of 1909. Some areas were as much as 14 feet underwater.  However, the flood damage was minimal since there  were still not many buildings in the new town.

Thirteen years later, the  flood of 1922 was another matter. By then,  Mercedes was more developed. Residents tried to protect the city by building temporary levees.  However, their efforts were futile. The makeshift levees broke and the downtown was severely flooded causing damage to many buildings.

The flood occurred just months after the city had been incorporated the same year. [21]   The promotional brochures that land developers sent to potential buyers in the early 1900s did not mention that the paradise they were advertising was prone to  hurricanes and floods.  

After an even more severe flood in 1922,  construction began on an extensive system of levees and floodways to protect Mercedes and other towns in the lower Rio Grande Valley. This floodway system has been extended and continues to protect the area today in 2023. </p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/U021.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5513/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div id="flexHeader"><p2>Mercedes was the Site of Natural Disasters<br><br><a href=index.html class="button" target="_blank">Home</a></p2></div><div id="flexHeader"></div><br></body></html>

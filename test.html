Rio Rico was originally located north of the Rio Grande River on land surrounded by a bend in the river. In July 1906, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built a cutoff to direct the river into a more direct course. As a result, Río Rico came to be located south of the border in Mexico. No longer clearly part of either the United States or Mexico, Río Rico became a lawless territory where gambling, dance halls, and saloons flourished.  The Tivoli, named after a renowned nightclub in Italy, was the first and most well-known nightclub. Here is some more information just to have more test to look at. [43] [75] [94]</p1></body></html>

<p3>Throughout Mercedes history, the name Fuste has been associated with a variety of landmarks and has appeared in several spellings, including Fusti, Fuste, Fuesti, and Fueste. The Fusti Ranch was originally owned by the heirs of Spanish land grantee Ynojosa de BallÃ­. A ravine that drained the ranch and surrounding area into the Arroyo Colorado became known as El Fuste.

In 1907, during the construction of the Mercedes Main Canal, a structure built across this ravine was named the El Fuste Syphon. Over time, a neighborhood grew on the land once part of the ranch, and it too came to be called El Fuste.

Residents later attempted to incorporate the area as a separate city under the name El Fueste, but these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1960, the neighborhood was officially annexed by the city of Mercedes.

At various points in time, El Fuste has referred to a ranch, a ravine, a concrete drain, a neighborhood, and even a proposed cityâ€”highlighting its deep-rooted connection to the region's history.</p3></div><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/FusteBrownsvilleHerald1907.jpg"><p1><div><font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Completion of El Fuste Under Mercedes Canal </strong></font><font color=#555555>1907-07-12</font>
<br><br><p1>The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company completed two inverted siphon tubes under El Fuste arroyo on Sunday February 25 105. The tubes are 600 feet long and 7 feet 9 inches in diameter with a carrying capacity of 120000 gallons per minute each. They are made of reinforced concrete and were built to carry irrigation water from the canal under the bed of the arroyo. The project was planned by Chester B. Davis and supervised by Edward H. Forney. The work was completed ahead of schedule despite threatening rain. The remaining two tubes are still under construction but irrigation of the companys land does not depend on their completion.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>A petition is being circulated among the citizens of Mercedes asking for a change in the location and size of the proposed new bridge across El Fuste. El Fuste is a resaca which is a natural drainage for overflow waters from Lake Llano Grande. However due to recent drainage work El Fuste now carries more water. Additionally recent rains have caused water to rise to the timbers of the bridge. It is feared that additional overflow will carry the bridge away cutting off wagon traffic between people living on the other side. County commissioners have promised to provide an adequate bridge now that they have been alerted to the situation.</p1><br><br>

A large portion of the proposed town is located in the area that the Mercedes City Council previously proposed to annex. Legal experts have not yet determined which action will take precedence. It is generally understood that the petitioners made their move to avoid annexation.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>Judge Milton Richardson has canceled the election to determine whether to allow the town of El Fuste to incorporate. A group of residents had asked for the election to prevent the city of Mercedes from annexing the area. The judge ruled that the City of Mercedes had prior jurisdiction over the area as it had duly passed a resolution on June 18 to annex and had mailed notices to property owners on June 25.  Texas law rules that when two munipalities are in dispute over an area the municipality which first took action has jurisdiction. </p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>The El Fuste Structure remains intact today, located in the area now known as the Mercedes Waterfall. However, the name 'Fuste' has faded from both the local lexicon and newspapers, and the surrounding area is no longer referred to as Fusteâ€”it has essentially been lost to time. The following Google Maps image shows what seem to be the four pipes that make up the El Fuste Syphon. These four pipes are located on the left side of the image, with Baseline Road to the north and the Mercedes Waterfalls visible on the right.</p1><br><br>

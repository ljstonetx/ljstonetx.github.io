The tubes are 600 feet long and 7 feet 9 inches in diameter with a carrying capacity of 120000 gallons per minute each. They are made of reinforced concrete and were built to carry irrigation water from the canal under the bed of the arroyo. The project was planned by Chester B. Davis and supervised by Edward H. Forney. The work was completed ahead of schedule despite threatening rain. The remaining two tubes are still under construction but irrigation of the companys land does not depend on their completion.</p1><a href=imagesColorized/FusteBrownsvilleHerald1907.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><a href=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth147506/m1/1/ / class="button">View Source Article</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/fuste1914.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Residents Want New Bridge Across El Fuste </strong></font><font color="#414141">1914-05-27 </font><br><br><p1>A petition is being circulated among the citizens of Mercedes asking for a change in the location and size of the proposed new bridge across El Fuste. El Fuste is a resaca which is a natural drainage for overflow waters from Lake Llano Grande. However due to recent drainage work El Fuste now carries more water. Additionally recent rains have caused water to rise to the timbers of the bridge. It is feared that additional overflow will carry the bridge away cutting off wagon traffic between people living on the other side. County commissioners have promised to provide an adequate bridge now that they have been alerted to the situation.</p1><a href=imagesColorized/fuste1914.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><a href=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth987280// class="button">View Source Article</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/me07011914.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Work Commenced on New Bridge </strong></font><font color="#414141">1914-07-01 </font><br><br><p1>El Fuste to be spanned by a new structure as a result of citizen request.

A group of residents had asked for the election to prevent the city of Mercedes from annexing the area. The judge ruled that the City of Mercedes had prior jurisdiction over the area as it had duly passed a resolution on June 18 to annex and had mailed notices to property owners on June 25.  Texas law rules that when two munipalities are in dispute over an area the municipality which first took action has jurisdiction. </p1><a href=imagesColorized/fuste1960_1.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><a href=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth1091041// class="button">View Source Article</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/fuste1967.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>El Fuste Area Assigned for City Cleanup </strong></font><font color="#414141">1967-03-09 </font><br><br><p1>Assigments for organization scheduled to lead designated areas of Mercedes in the Aprial Cleanup Campaign were announced.

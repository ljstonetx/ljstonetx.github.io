El Fuste is a resaca which is a natural drainage for overflow waters from Lake Llano Grande. However due to recent drainage work El Fuste now carries more water. Additionally recent rains have caused water to rise to the timbers of the bridge. It is feared that additional overflow will carry the bridge away cutting off wagon traffic between people living on the other side. County commissioners have promised to provide an adequate bridge now that they have been alerted to the situation.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/fuste1914.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth987280//>View Source Article</a></div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/fuste1960_3.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Proposed Map for New City of El Fuste </strong></font><font color="grey">1960-06-30 </font><br><p1>Property owners living in the El Fuste area bordering Mercedes proposed to incorporate as a separate city named El Fuste.

The tubes are 600 feet long and 7 feet 9 inches in diameter with a carrying capacity of 120000 gallons per minute each. They are made of reinforced concrete and were built to carry irrigation water from the canal under the bed of the arroyo. The project was planned by Chester B. Davis and supervised by Edward H. Forney. The work was completed ahead of schedule despite threatening rain. The remaining two tubes are still under construction but irrigation of the companys land does not depend on their completion.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/FusteBrownsvilleHerald1907.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/>View Source Article</a></div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/fuste1967.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>El Fuste Area Assigned for City Cleanup </strong></font><font color="grey">1967-03-09 </font><br><p1>Assigments for organization scheduled to lead designated areas of Mercedes in the Aprial Cleanup Campaign were announced.

A group of residents had asked for the election to prevent the city of Mercedes from annexing the area. The judge ruled that the City of Mercedes had prior jurisdiction over the area as it had duly passed a resolution on June 18 to annex and had mailed notices to property owners on June 25.  Texas law rules that when two munipalities are in dispute over an area the municipality which first took action has jurisdiction. </p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/fuste1960_1.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/>View Source Article</a></div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/fuste1960_2.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Group Petitions for New City of El Fuste </strong></font><font color="grey">1960-06-30 </font><br><p1>A judge has signed an order to hold an election to determine whether to incorporate the City of El Fuste and the election date has been set.

Shaw farm) crossed the Fueste west of the present crossing and then turned directly to the road following the canal to the Military Road at Relampago - with cross roads at several places to the east. 

The El Fueste Settlement was something - consisting of about 100 jacals- which must have been a work camp site for the American Company in those days. This tract of land was afterwards purchased by W.F. Shaw the Chief Engineer of the AMerican Company fenced and then the road was changed to go Capisallo Road along the canal from the then southern city limits. However Mr. Shawâ€™s purchase included this rig of way and then the road south cas changed to the now named Florida Street (just across the canal) and the crossing of the El Fuste Arroyo was moved to its present crossing and a new low water bridge built.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/fuste1975.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=/>View Source Article</a></div></div><br><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/me07011914.jpg"><p1><div><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Work Commenced on New Bridge </strong></font><font color="grey">1914-07-01 </font><br><p1>El Fuste to be spanned by a new structure as a result of citizen request.

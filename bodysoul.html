  <h1>üè• Mercedes General Hospital</h1>

  <h2>Origins: The Elks Lodge Era (1922‚Äì1930s)</h2>
  <p>In 1922, the <strong>Mercedes Elks Lodge</strong> established the town‚Äôs first hospital‚Äîa small facility to serve the growing community. By 1928, they replaced it with a larger building, shown in the historic postcard. Featuring white stucco walls, red tile roofing, and soft arches, the structure embodied the popular <strong>Spanish Colonial Revival style</strong> of the era.</p>
  <p>Although it lacked air conditioning, the hospital used open windows and a shaded front porch to offer some relief from the South Texas heat. Several potted plants decorated the entry steps. In the background of the image, the <strong>First Baptist Church</strong> is visible. [38]</p>

  <h2>Features and Transition to Public Ownership</h2>
  <p>The hospital included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>12 private rooms</li>
    <li>An open ward</li>
    <li>A red tile roof and arched colonnade</li>
    <li>A front porch typical of early 20th-century designs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many local children were born there. However, during the economic hardship of the <strong>Great Depression</strong>, the Elks Lodge could no longer sustain operations. In the 1930s, the <strong>City of Mercedes took over</strong>, renaming it <strong>Mercedes General Hospital</strong>. [66]</p>

  <h2>Later Use and Closure</h2>
  <p>The hospital served Mercedes for several decades. In the <strong>early 1960s</strong>, it closed following the opening of <strong>Knapp Memorial Hospital</strong> in nearby Weslaco. The building then served as a <strong>nursing home</strong> before being demolished in the <strong>late 1960s</strong> to make way for a senior apartment high-rise. [66]</p>

  <h1>üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Early Physicians of Mercedes</h1>
  <p>Several key figures shaped early medical care in Mercedes, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dr. Caldera</li>
    <li>Dr. De La Torre</li>
    <li>Dr. Edwards</li>
    <li>Dr. Caballero</li>
    <li>Dr. Johnston</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dr. Johnston and Dr. Caballero also operated their own hospital on <strong>3rd Street</strong>, where a medical clinic still exists today.</p>
  <p>One notable native son is <strong>Dr. Hector P. Garcia</strong>‚Äîa physician, World War II veteran, and civil rights activist. He founded the <strong>American GI Forum</strong> and is honored locally with the <strong>naming of the public library</strong>. [15]</p>

  <h1>‚õ™ Churches of Early Mercedes</h1>

  <h2>First Methodist Church / El Buen Pastor Iglesia Methodista</h2>
  <p>The <strong>First Methodist Church of Mercedes</strong> constructed a Mission Revival-style building in the 1930s. Characterized by arched windows and a stucco exterior, it served the congregation until the 1960s.</p>
  <p>After the Methodists relocated, the building was used by <strong>El Buen Pastor Iglesia Methodista</strong> until the late 1960s, when it was demolished and rebuilt on the same site. [27]</p>

  <h2>Unidentified Mission Revival Church</h2>
  <p>A nearby church in the <strong>Mission Revival style</strong>‚Äîfeaturing a parapet bell tower and symmetrical arches‚Äîremains <strong>unidentified</strong>. Its architecture reflects early 20th-century design trends influenced by Spanish missions and Southwestern aesthetics.</p>

  <h2>Immanuel Lutheran Church</h2>
  <p>This <strong>Lutheran church</strong>, marked by the presence of palm trees at its entrance, was built in <strong>1911</strong>. Its box-shaped steeple and simple design resemble rural German churches in Texas. According to postcard notes, the structure was later <strong>moved to San Juan, Texas</strong>. [17][59]</p>
  <p>(See card W038 for an aerial view.)</p>

  <h2>First Presbyterian Church of Mercedes</h2>
  <p>Founded in <strong>1909</strong> by Evangelist <strong>S.M. Glasgow</strong>, the First Presbyterian Church was built in <strong>1912</strong> at Fourth and Missouri. The sanctuary featured a <strong>diagonal interior layout</strong>, stucco-covered brick, and served its congregation for decades.</p>
  <p>A 1914 newspaper noted:</p>
  <blockquote>
    ‚ÄúPreaching services every Sabbath, except the 3rd, at 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. Sabbath school, 9:45 every Sabbath. Christian Endeavor, 7 p.m.‚Äù
  </blockquote>
  <p>In <strong>1947</strong>, the church was remodeled with classrooms, a kitchen, and a Mission Revival-style parapet. A <strong>pipe organ imported from Germany</strong>, funded by the <strong>Mary Stotler Fund</strong>, was installed. When a new church was built on <strong>Texas Avenue in 1972</strong>, the organ was transferred and remains in use today. [48][60]</p>

  <h2>First Baptist Church of Mercedes</h2>
  <p>Organized in <strong>1907</strong>, the First Baptist Church built its impressive complex in <strong>1920</strong>, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sanctuary and bell tower</li>
    <li>Auditorium with balcony seating for 750</li>
    <li>Classrooms, kitchen, and fellowship hall</li>
    <li>Art glass windows and decorative electric lighting</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Described by the local paper as ‚Äúone of the most magnificent church edifices in this part of the state,‚Äù the church closed in the <strong>1990s</strong>. Today, the building is still standing and has been repurposed as a <strong>mission church and preschool</strong>. [44]</p>

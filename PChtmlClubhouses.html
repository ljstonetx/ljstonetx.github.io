<p3>Land developers built clubhouses to attract buyers, offering upscale amenities. Stewart Clubhouse located Southeast of Mercedes was the most noted of these, but it is no longer standing. Several others including the Llano Grande Club house are still standing today.</p3></div><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/L025.jpg"><p1><font color=#555555>L025</font>
<font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Llano Grande Resort Clubhouse Still Stands West of Mercedes </strong></font><font color=#555555>1940</font>
<br><br><p1>The Llano Grande Country Club House was the one of many buildings in the Mercedes area designed by architect Newell Waters. Construction began in 1928. The structure was built of hollow tile covered with stucco, with a Spanish tile roof and reinforced concrete foundation. A tower was located on the west side, and the first floor contained a ladies' parlor, men's locker rooms, and showers. The club house was finished inside and out with native wood.  According to the local newspaper, the club house was 'situated on the banks of the Llano Grande Lake in one of the most beautiful spots in the Valley.' [57]

The building later became a residence for Harold Lehman. Today the clubhouse serves as offices for the Llano Grande Lake Park Resort. [4]</p1><br><br>

<font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Stewart Club House Was On Beautiful Resaca Southeast of Mercedes </strong></font><font color=#555555>1920</font>
<br><br><p1>The Stewart Club House was one of many clubhouses Mercedes land developers built to entertain customers during the early 1900s.  It was located on Llano Grande Lake near Mercedes. The lake is now known as Progresso Lake and the Club House no longer stands.  The lake is actually a resaca, an arm of the Rio Grande River that became isolated when the river changed course.

The W.E. Stewart Land Company promotional brochure lured buyers with this exaggerated description: 'This is where the Stewart Land Co. entertain their excursions parties while in the Rio Grande Valley.  Beautiful Rio Grande Lake is long and deep, its banks overshadowed with trees. The slopes are covered with sweet scented wildflowers, and fishing provides a profitable pastime'.

<br><br><p1>The image of the Stewart Club House was featured in the land development company promotional brochure. In 1913, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company acquired a significant portion of the Llano Grande grant and developed the West Tract. [35] In 1916, the United States government stationed troops along the Rio Grande to control raids from Mexico and established a camp at the Llano Grande railroad depot, near Mercedes. The guardsmen erected a watchtower at Progreso. On December 14, 1917, the irrigation company sold 30,000 acres at 90 dollars per acre to the W. E. Stewart Land Company. [53]</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>A hand written caption says 1918 W.E. Stewart Clubhouse Mercedes Mile 2 West and Lake. This appears to be a rear view of the structure since there the driveway is not covered. The clubhouse featured interesting white lattice work and rooftop beans. There was a small balcony above the main entrace.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>This photograph, likely taken after a period of heavy rainfall, captures a flooded Llano Grande Lakeâ€”now known as Progreso Lake. In the image, trees stand partially submerged, emphasizing the extent of the flooding. A group of people in a rowboat appears in the foreground, adding a human element to the scene. The lake itself is a resaca, a former channel of the Rio Grande that became cut off from the main river when it shifted course.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>This Dutch Colonial style structure was built by the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company as a clubhouse for prospective land buyers in the 1910s. [35] It still stands on Harmony Hill, just North of Mercedes.  Over the years it has served as the location for various organizations and clubs. Many modifications have been made to the original structure, and it is now abandoned and in need of repair. </p1><br><br>

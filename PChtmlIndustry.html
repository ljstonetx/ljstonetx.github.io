Brickmakers were skilled craftsmen who understood selection and harvesting of  clay, building molds, pouring clay, as well building wood fired kilns and firing bricks.  

Brickmaking skills were passed generationally through families. One family member described their skills: 'They all knew how to mold [haver hechura]. They knew clay, which clay to use for brick. They knew how to fire [quemar]. They knew how to set [asentrar] bricks in the kiln. They learned all that from their father'.

Brickyards like this one were located south of Mercedes, close to the Rio Grande River, where deposits of alluvial clays provided the raw material needed for brick manufacturing. [9] Typically, buildings using this type of brick were covered with stucco. Some of the early buildings standing today are probably constructed using this locally produced brick. These include the Graham School at 203 W 10th Street and the building at 246 S Texas Street, which was the original Hidalgo Bank.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/B002.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5158/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/U152.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> U152</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Bricks Drying at Relampago Brick Factory </strong></font><font color="grey">1960 </font><br><font size="2.5em">In 1902 the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company acquired a parcel of land where they established the town of Relampago in 1908. A devastating flood in 1910 nearly wiped out the town. This brick factory built to utilize river mud from the Rio Grande for brick production survived the disaster. Many early buildings in Mercedes were built from these bricks. The factory remained operational until the 1960s. Today  Relampago persists as a small community.[89]</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/U152.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://scholarworks.utrgv.edu/miscphotosedinburg/345/>View UTRGV Miscellaneous</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/U155.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> U155</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Relampago Factory Produced Bricks for Early Mercedes </strong></font><font color="grey">1960 </font><br><font size="2.5em">The factory operated until sometime in the 1960s.

Johnson, William M. Price, S.P. Silver, and John Closner. It was the first bank in Mercedes. Several of the founders were also investors in the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company. Other early banks in Mercedes included Planters Bank and First National Bank. In 1928, Hidalgo County Bank moved to a new building that was constructed diagonally across the street in the empty lot seen here. The bank survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and thrived until it collapsed during the banking crisis in 1989.  The original building still stands today and has been occupied by many businesses over the years.

Hidalgo County Bank and Trust was 82 years, 26 days old when it was closed  on July 26, 1989 by the Texas State Banking Commission after being declared insolvent.

It became the Chamber of Commerce Building in the 1940s. [64][65] When  the older Mercedes Hotel that stood at the corner of Texas and Second Street was demolished in the 1950s, this building became a hotel, and was renamed the Mercedes Hotel.

Upon completion of the building in 1928, the newspaper reported  'The building with its spacious corner lot represents a total investment of 65,000 dollars and is one of the most handsome fraternal lodge homes south of San Antonio. It is of beautiful architectural design and modern in all of its appointments. The interior has been neatly and artistically decorated and it now awaits furnishing.'

According to the historic marker at the former site:  The citrus industry was an integral part of the Rio Grande Valley economy in the 20th century.  In 1932, valley citrus producers formed the Rio Grande Valley Citrus Exchange. The exchange began production under the labels of TexSun and TexMaid, and later had a box company, juicing and canning facilities, and a dehydration plant for citrus pulp-based cattle feed.  Texsun became a public corporation in 1956. The plant ceased operations in 1991. [92] Today, the Citrus World Corporation produces juice with the TexSun name today from citrus grown in Florida and Mexico.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/F007.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5347/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/Q002.jpg"><p class="b"><font color="grey"> Q002</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Many Mercedes Residents Worked For Texsun Juice Plant </strong></font><font color="grey">1949 </font><br><font size="2.5em">This is an advertisement postcard for the Texsun Juice Company. The company produced juice from Valley citrus oranges and grapefruits from the 1930s until 1991. The citrus processing plant was located between Mercedes and Weslaco at one time.  Families living near the plant recall the ever-present scent of oranges and grapefruits being processed and the sound of boilers running 24 hours a day.

Texsun Juice Company was a major employer in the area until the late 1980s. In order to save money and increase profits, farmers began to grow less labor-intensive crops such as grain, cotton, and sugarcane instead of citrus. As a result of reduced citrus production, the company eventually closed.</font><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/Q002.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5337/>View High Resolution</a></div><div id="flexHeader"><h1><center>Mercedes Texas Historic Photographs 1900s to 1950s</center></div></h1><div id="flexHeader"><div>Subject: Industry</div><div2><a href="PCSubjects.html" target="_blank">Home</a></div2><div>mercedestx@gmail.com</div></div></body></html>

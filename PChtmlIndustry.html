<p3>Early Mercedes industries included banking, brick making, agriculture and beverage production. An active civic group that promoted Mercedes industry later became the Chamber of Commerce. The Mercedes Elks Club and elegant ballroom was a popular venue for business and social events.</p3></div><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/U_160.jpg"><p1><font color=#555555>U_160</font>

<font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Brickyard Supplied Materials for Mission Revival Style Buildings in Early Mercedes </strong></font><font color=#555555>1907</font>
<br><br><p1>The demand for bricks was high, as Mercedes ordinances required certain buildings to be constructed using masonry or stone, the architectural aesthetic preferred by city founders. Brickyards like this one were located south of Mercedes, close to the Rio Grande River, where deposits of alluvial clays provided the raw material needed for brick manufacturing. [9] Typically, buildings using this type of brick were covered with stucco. Some of the early buildings standing today are probably constructed using this locally produced brick. These include the Graham School at 203 W 10th Street and the building at 246 S Texas Street, which was the original Hidalgo Bank.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>In 1902 the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company acquired a parcel of land where they established the town of Relampago in 1908. A devastating flood in 1910 nearly wiped out the town. This brick factory built to utilize river mud from the Rio Grande for brick production survived the disaster. Many early buildings in Mercedes were built from these bricks. The factory remained operational until the 1960s. Today  Relampago persists as a small community.[89]</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>The factory operated until sometime in the 1960s. There is a large kiln in the center, and 10 small kilns on the left, each with a chimney. There are stacks of wood to fire the kilns on the left side. The railroad in front provided transportation to Mercedes and other markets [89]</p1><br><br>

<font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Original Hidalgo County Bank Building on Northeast Corner of Texas and 3rd </strong></font><font color=#555555>1913</font>
<br><br><p1>The Hidalgo County Bank building, which is pictured here was founded in 1907 by J.M. Johnson, William M. Price, S.P. Silver, and John Closner. It was the first bank in Mercedes. Several of the founders were also investors in the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company. Other early banks in Mercedes included Planters Bank and First National Bank. In 1928, Hidalgo County Bank moved to a new building that was constructed diagonally across the street in the empty lot seen here. The bank survived the Great Depression of the 1930s and thrived until it collapsed during the banking crisis in 1989.  The original building still stands today and has been occupied by many businesses over the years. [93]</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>Looking Northeast in Mercedes from the corner of Texas Avenue and 3rd Street at Hidalgo County Bank in its original building which was built in 1907.  The building has changed hands many times over the years. For several decades, it was Queen City Drug which had a full soda fountain and a huge cosmetic counter. Today the building houses a restaurant. The building and those to its right still retain many of their original Spanish Colonial architectural features. The bank moved to a new building in 1928.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>When the Hidalgo County Bank moved to this new building in 1928, the newspaper said 'One of the most modern structures in South Texas, and the only building outside Brownsville to be equipped with elevator service. Steam heat is provided for every office...The interior of banking rooms present a most unusual effect with walnut fixtures throughout, and a tile floor of rich mosaic colorings. Windows for ten tellers are provided, with separate offices for bank officials. ' The building was one of several in Mercedes designed by R. Newell Waters. [69]

Hidalgo County Bank and Trust was 82 years, 26 days old when it was closed  on July 26, 1989 by the Texas State Banking Commission after being declared insolvent.  [93] The building remains standing today in 2023, but the fine exterior was covered over during a renovation project in the 1990s.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>Production of beverages from citrus was a major industry in the Mercedes area.  Valley Industries, located between Mercedes and Weslaco, produced beverages such as Delaware Punch.

Even industrial buildings included Mission Revival architecture features such as the parapets which crown the exterior walls of the Valley Industry buildings seen in this postcard.

The advertisement on the back of this card says: The Valley Home of Delaware Punch. The largest Beverage plant in South Texas where only pure food beverages are manufactured. Volume at this plant makes it possible to market beverages with a fruit base to retail at five cents per bottle.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>The TexSun Company near Mercedes produced orange and grapefruit Juice for consumers across the United States. According to the historic marker at the former site:  The citrus industry was an integral part of the Rio Grande Valley economy in the 20th century.  In 1932, valley citrus producers formed the Rio Grande Valley Citrus Exchange. The exchange began production under the labels of TexSun and TexMaid, and later had a box company, juicing and canning facilities, and a dehydration plant for citrus pulp-based cattle feed.  Texsun became a public corporation in 1956. The plant ceased operations in 1991. [92] Today, the Citrus World Corporation produces juice with the TexSun name today from citrus grown in Florida and Mexico.</p1><br><br>

<font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Many Mercedes Residents Worked For Texsun Juice Plant </strong></font><font color=#555555>1949</font>
<br><br><p1>This is an advertisement postcard for the Texsun Juice Company. The company produced juice from Valley citrus oranges and grapefruits from the 1930s until 1991. The citrus processing plant was located between Mercedes and Weslaco at one time.  Families living near the plant recall the ever-present scent of oranges and grapefruits being processed and the sound of boilers running 24 hours a day.

Texsun Juice Company was a major employer in the area until the late 1980s. In order to save money and increase profits, farmers began to grow less labor-intensive crops such as grain, cotton, and sugarcane instead of citrus. As a result of reduced citrus production, the company eventually closed.</p1><br><br>

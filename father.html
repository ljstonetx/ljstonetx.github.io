  <h1>My Father and C9ORF72</h1>

  <p>
    The discovery that defects in the <em>C9ORF72</em> gene are the most common genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has transformed our understanding of these devastating diseases. Mutations in this gene can cause ALS, FTD, or a combination of both—blurring the line between cognitive and neuromuscular degeneration.
  </p>

  <p>This is my father’s story—his journey through ALS/FTD, shaped by the hidden legacy of the <em>C9ORF72</em> gene.</p>

  <h2>Walter's Princeton Class Reunion Biography Entry</h2>
  <h3><em>Written by Louise Jensen, 2002</em></h3>

  <p>My father, Walter Jensen, died on November 3, 1973, in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Houston, Texas. Nearly 30 years later, my mother contributed this tribute to his 50th Princeton Class Reunion biography:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Walter came to Princeton on a special scholarship. At 17, he left his home in Washington State with $200 in his pocket and hitchhiked 3,000 miles to New Jersey. He supported himself by washing dishes, waiting tables, working in the Yakima Valley during the summers, and in Alaska. He studied at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs and made the Dean's List for seven of his eight semesters.<br><br>
    He joined the U.S. Air Force during the Korean conflict and, while a navigation cadet at Harlingen Air Force Base, met and married Louise Prothro.<br><br>
    As a career officer, Walter was stationed in England and at various U.S. bases. In 1961, he became Chief of Navigation and Scheduling at Schilling AFB for the Strategic Air Command. He was selected to attend the Command and Staff School in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1964. But there, he was afflicted by a nervous disorder that led to his medical discharge.<br><br>
    For the remainder of his life, he fought a courageous battle against a disease that remains poorly understood to this day.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What Happened to My Father?</h2>

  <p>
    In 1965, my father—a decorated Air Force Captain—suffered what was then termed a “nervous breakdown.” Only a year before, he had been leading a missile squadron during the Cold War and had been commended for developing advanced navigation algorithms during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Now, he struggled with basic arithmetic. His sharp memory and strategic mind deteriorated into confusion and cognitive lapses.
  </p>

  <p>
    He was never the same. As I came of age, I was haunted by the question: <em>What happened to my father?</em> The answer would take decades to uncover.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnosis in the Dark</h2>

  <p>
    Walter’s achievements led to his selection for the elite Rank and Staff School in Montgomery, Alabama. Our family relocated there, and for a brief time, we were happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the change came swiftly. He began having trouble sleeping, concentrating, and completing simple tasks. Concerned, the Air Force referred him to Randolph Air Force Hospital in San Antonio, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 1960s saw a boom in psychiatric experimentation. Walter was subjected to dozens of electroshock treatments and powerful medications. Yet instead of improving, he worsened. My mother, desperate for answers, moved us from Alabama to Washington, and then to Houston, seeking help from VA psychiatric hospitals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, we settled in a small Texas town where my mother had grown up. Walter continued receiving care, but he was a shell of his former self—quiet, vacant, and diminished. At sixteen, I scoured libraries and bookstores for answers, reading everything I could about schizophrenia. But Walter didn’t fit the mold. He had no hallucinations, delusions, or erratic outbursts. Just silence. Just absence.
  </p>

  <h2>Walter’s Final Years</h2>

  <p>
    After 1969, Walter no longer returned home. He remained in the VA hospital in Houston. Despite the distance, my mother visited him every month—driving 350 miles alone from our small town.
  </p>

  <p>
    I convinced myself that Walter could be healed with vitamins and nutrition. I enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin to study Clinical Nutrition, determined to save him with niacin and an organic diet. But two months into my first semester, my mother called. Walter had slipped into a coma from respiratory failure.
  </p>

  <p>He died a month later.</p>

  <h2>The Forgotten Letter</h2>

  <p>
    After Walter’s death, we knew little about his family. His mother Marie had died in 1959; his father Holger, in 1968. Before his death, Holger sent us a satchel of letters and photographs that went unopened for decades.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 1980s, I finally opened it. Inside were letters Walter had written as a Princeton student in the late 1940s. In them, he mentioned that Marie was being treated for a neurological disorder at the county hospital in Yakima.
  </p>

  <p>
    One letter, dated 1964, was from a man named Gunnar Dalsgaard in Ålborg, Denmark. I didn’t recognize the name or have any way to reach him. With young children and a career, I pushed it aside—but I never forgot.
  </p>

  <h2>Journey to Denmark</h2>

  <p>
    In 2010, I found distant cousins in Washington State. They confirmed that Walter’s parents, Holger and Marie, had emigrated from Northern Denmark—Jutland. Marie’s maiden name? Dalsgaard. Just like the man in the letter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I contacted a genealogist in Denmark. His research revealed that Marie was the eldest of 12 siblings. The letter-writer, Gunnar, was her younger brother. Though he had passed away, his children—Ebbe and Anne Marie—were still living in Hjørring, the family’s ancestral village.
  </p>

  <p>
    My sisters and I traveled to Denmark. The cousins welcomed us with open arms. We visited the family homestead, where the name “Dalsgaard” was still etched in stone. They shared a family tree stretching back generations—and an unsettling pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Four of Marie’s siblings, including Ebbe, had died of ALS. Marie had displayed similar symptoms. Another brother had been institutionalized for life at Denmark’s largest psychiatric hospital. Like Walter, he had lived in a near-catatonic state.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s when I began to understand: Walter hadn’t suffered from schizophrenia. He likely had a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder.
  </p>

  <h2>The Eureka Moment</h2>

  <p>
    Still searching, I read an article in <em>Neuron</em> titled <em>“ALS and FTD: Genetic Ties That Bind.”</em> The opening line stunned me:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “At first glance, one might think that a paralytic disease caused by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is unlikely to be linked to a disease that presents with progressive changes in personality and language, frontotemporal dementia (FTD).”  
    <br>[Orr, 2011]
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It explained that the <em>C9ORF72</em> gene mutation could cause both ALS and FTD—sometimes in the same person. The gene is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with a 50% chance of being passed on. Its manifestations range from language loss and personality change to muscle wasting and respiratory failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Walter’s symptoms—his dramatic cognitive decline, emotional flattening, and language problems—aligned far more with FTD than schizophrenia. Marie’s decline suggested ALS. It was a pattern: a spectrum disorder that spanned generations.
  </p>

  <p>This mutation, I realized, could explain everything.</p>

  <h2>Reflections</h2>

  <p>
    In the 1960s, schizophrenia was a broad diagnosis, often assigned when doctors lacked better tools or understanding. Walter’s misdiagnosis was not their fault—it was a limitation of the era.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, researchers know that <em>C9ORF72</em> mutations are the most common genetic cause of familial ALS and FTD [Gitler, 2016]. New studies aim to develop targeted therapies and uncover the mechanisms behind this complex gene [Balendra, 2018].
  </p>

  <p>
    Now in our 60s, my siblings and I have shown no signs of ALS or FTD. If we carried the <em>C9ORF72</em> mutation, we likely would have developed symptoms by now. Since the gene is dominant, our children are also free from the risk. Still, we wonder: could our brothers, who died as young adults, have carried it?
  </p>

  <p>
    There is peace in knowing. There is hope in the science.
  </p>

  <p>
    Supporting organizations like the ALS Association and the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration is vital. These groups fund groundbreaking research and offer critical resources to families like ours—families still searching for answers, and for healing.

 <h1>My Father and C9ORF72</h1>
  
</div>
  <p>This is my father’s story—his journey through ALS/FTD, shaped by the hidden legacy of the <em>C9ORF72</em> gene.</p>
  <p>
    The discovery that defects in the <em>C9ORF72</em> gene are the most common genetic cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has transformed our understanding of these devastating diseases. Mutations in this gene can cause ALS, FTD, or a combination of both—blurring the line between cognitive and neuromuscular degeneration.

 <h3><em>Written by Louise Jensen, 2002</em></h3>
</div>
  <p>My father, Walter Jensen, died on November 3, 1973, in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Houston, Texas. My mother contributed this tribute to his Princeton Class Reunion biography:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Walter came to Princeton on a special scholarship. At 17, he left his home in Washington State with $200 in his pocket and hitchhiked 3,000 miles to New Jersey. He supported himself by washing dishes, waiting tables, working in the Yakima Valley during the summers, and in Alaska. He studied at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs and made the Dean's List for seven of his eight semesters.<br><br>
    He joined the U.S. Air Force during the Korean conflict and, while a navigation cadet at Harlingen Air Force Base, met and married Louise Prothro.<br><br>
    As a career officer, Walter was stationed in England and at various U.S. bases. In 1961, he became Chief of Navigation and Scheduling at Schilling AFB for the Strategic Air Command. He was selected to attend the Command and Staff School in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1964. But there, he was afflicted by a nervous disorder that led to his medical discharge.<br><br>
    For the remainder of his life, he fought a courageous battle against a disease that remains poorly understood to this day.

  <h2>What Happened to My Father?</h2>  
</div>
  <p>
    In 1965, my father—a decorated Air Force Captain—suffered what was then termed a “nervous breakdown.” Only a year before, he had been leading a missile squadron during the Cold War and had been commended for developing advanced navigation algorithms during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Now, he struggled with basic arithmetic. His sharp memory and strategic mind deteriorated into confusion and cognitive lapses.
  </p>
  <p>
    He was never the same. As I came of age, I was haunted by the question: 
	<em>What happened to my father?</em> 
	The answer would take decades to uncover.
  </p>

 <div class="header-container">

  <h2>Diagnosis in the Dark</h2>
</div>

  <p>
    Walter’s achievements led to his selection for the Air Force Rank and Staff School in Montgomery, Alabama. Our family relocated there while he was groomed for advancement in the Air Force. For a brief time,our family was happy in our new home.
  </p>

  <p>
    But change came swiftly. Walter began having trouble sleeping, concentrating, and completing simple tasks. Concerned, the Air Force referred him to Randolph Air Force Hospital in San Antonio, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 1960s saw a boom in psychiatric experimentation. Walter was subjected to dozens of electroshock treatments and powerful medications. Yet instead of improving, he worsened. My mother, desperate for answers, moved us from Alabama to Washington, and then to Houston, seeking help from VA psychiatric hospitals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, we settled in a small Texas town where my mother had grown up. Walter continued receiving care, but he was a shell of his former self—quiet, vacant, and diminished. At sixteen, I scoured libraries and bookstores for answers, reading everything I could about schizophrenia. But Walter didn’t fit the mold. He had no hallucinations, delusions, or erratic outbursts. Just silence. Just absence.
  </p>

  <h2>Walter's Final Years</h2>
</div>
  
  <p>
    After 1969, Walter never lived with us at home again. He remained in the VA hospital in Houston. Despite the distance, my mother visited him every month—driving 350 miles alone from our small town.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was the dawn of a health food boom and I convinced myself that Walter could be healed with vitamins and nutrition. I enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin to study Clinical Nutrition, determined to save him with niacin and an organic diet. But two months into my first semester, my mother called. Walter had slipped into a coma from respiratory failure. He died a month later.</p>

 <h2>The Forgotten Letter</h2>
</div>
  <p>
    I knew little about Walter's family and ancestry. His mother Marie had died in 1959 and I never met her, I met his father Holger only once, and he died in 1968 when I was thirteen. After he died, my mother received a satchel containing his papers, letters and photographs. The papers sat unexamined in a closet for many years.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 1980s, I began to get curious and opened it. There wereletters Walter had written as a Princeton student in the late 1940s. In them, he mentioned that Marie was being treated for a neurological disorder at the county hospital in Yakima, Washington.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another letter to Holger, dated 1964, was from a man named Gunnar Dalsgaard in Ålborg, Denmark. From it's tone, I could tell Gunnar was a relative. I didn’t recognize the surname Dalsgaard. At the time I had young children and a career, and didn't have time to follow the lead — but I never forgot.
  </p>
<div class="header-container">
  <img src="imagesFather/MarieDalsgaardCrop.jpg" class="imgSmall">
  <h2>Journey to Denmark</h2>
</div>
  <p>
    In 2010, children grown, I started to do some research. Internet searching had now made searches for people far easier. I discovered distant cousins in Washington State. They confirmed that Walter’s parents, Holger and Marie, had emigrated from Northern Denmark—Jutland. Marie’s maiden name? Dalsgaard. Just like the man in the letter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I contacted a genealogist in Denmark. His research revealed that grandmother the eldest of Dalsgaard 12 siblings. The letter-writer, Gunnar, was her younger brother. Though he had passed away, his children—Ebbe and Anne Marie—were still living in Hjørring, the family’s ancestral village.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2014 yy sisters and I traveled to Denmark where our Dalsgaard cousins welcomed us. We visited the family homestead, where the name “Dalsgaard” was still etched in stone. They shared a family tree stretching back generations—and an unsettling pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    We were told that Four of Marie’s siblings, including Gunnar, had died of ALS. Marie had displayed similar symptoms. Another had been institutionalized for life at Denmark’s largest psychiatric hospital. Like Walter, he had lived in a near-catatonic state, speaking little, staring blankly.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s when I began to suspect: Walter hadn’t suffered from schizophrenia. He likely had a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder.
  </p>
<div class="header-container">
      <img src="imagesFather/DNA.jpg" class="imgSmall">
  <h2>The Eureka Moment</h2>
</div>
  <p>
    Still searching, I began to research medical journals and read an article in <em>Neuron</em> titled <em>“ALS and FTD: Genetic Ties That Bind.”</em> The opening line stunned me:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “At first glance, one might think that a paralytic disease caused by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is unlikely to be linked to a disease that presents with progressive changes in personality and language, frontotemporal dementia (FTD).”  
    <br>[Orr, 2011]
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The article explained that the <em>C9ORF72</em> gene mutation could cause both ALS and FTD—sometimes in the same person. The gene is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with a 50% chance of being passed on. Its manifestations range from language loss and personality change to muscle wasting and respiratory failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Walter’s symptoms—his dramatic cognitive decline, emotional flattening, and language problems—aligned far more with FTD than schizophrenia. Marie’s decline suggested ALS. It was a pattern: a spectrum disorder that spanned generations.
	
	Walter’s presentation—marked by cognitive decline, emotional flattening and progressive aphasia—was more consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) than schizophrenia. Marie’s trajectory, characterized by motor neuron deterioration, was indicative of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Taken together, the clinical patterns suggested a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder spanning generations.


	
	
  </p>

  <p>The discovery of this mutation provided a unifying explanation. It accounted for the phenotypic variability across family members and offered diagnostic clarity. For the first time, the findings aligned definitively with the observed symptoms.</p>
<div class="header-container">
  <h2>Reflections</h2>
	<img src="imagesFather/faReflection.jpg" class="imgSmall">
	</div>
  <p>
    In the 1960s, schizophrenia was a broad diagnosis, often assigned when doctors lacked better tools or understanding. Walter’s misdiagnosis was not their fault—it was a limitation of the era.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, researchers know that <em>C9ORF72</em> mutations are the most common genetic cause of familial ALS and FTD [Gitler, 2016]. New studies aim to develop targeted therapies and uncover the mechanisms behind this complex gene [Balendra, 2018].
  </p>

  <p>
    Now in our 60s, my siblings and I have shown no signs of ALS or FTD. If we carried the <em>C9ORF72</em> mutation, we likely would have developed symptoms by now. Since the gene is dominant, our children are also free from the risk. Still, we wonder: could our brothers, who died as young adults, have carried it?
  </p>

  <p>
    There is peace in knowing. There is hope in the science.
  </p>

  <p>
    Supporting organizations like the ALS Association and the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration is vital. These groups fund groundbreaking research and offer critical resources to families like ours—families still searching for answers, and for healing.

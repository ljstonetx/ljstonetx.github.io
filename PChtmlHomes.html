This group of Jacale homes near Mercedes housed ranch workers and their families.  Jacele homes were  constructed primarily from mesquite, but also ebony and other native woods . Mesquite was abundant locally, and was strong and durable. The homes were supported by upright poles and forked horcones (corner posts). Smaller mesquite limbs were placed horizontally across with clay sealing the openings.  [28]

Traditional ranch life was thriving into the late 1800s, but jacales dwindled as traditional ranching declined thereafter. There were few Jacales left in the Mercedes area following the hurricane of 1933.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5342/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/J004.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/U029.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">U029 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>German Farm Family Out For A Sunday Buggy Drive </strong></font><font color="#414141">1916 </font><br><br><p1>Here is a German family riding in a horse drawn buggy in front of their home. Developers advertised land near Mercedes in German newspapers. The ads attracted the attention of German farmers who bought and settled there in the early 1900s.  Their descendants continue to farm  in the area today. [17]

With its white porch columns, this home appears to be an Aladdin kit home ordered from a catalog and shipped via train from Michigan. Each kit came with a 75-page instruction book and thousands of pieces to be assembled upon arrival.  The Aladdin Company, founded 1908, was the first to manufacture kit homes, even before Sears & Roebuck. The homes were  popular in early Mercedes where materials such as cut lumber were not readily available.  This particular home appears to be the Cumberland Model featured in the 1915 Aladdin catalog.[39] [40]</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5541/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/U029.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/J005.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">J005 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>American Rio Grande Land Company Home Resembled Mercedes Hotel </strong></font><font color="#414141">1907 </font><br><br><p1>This home, at the Northwest corner of Missouri and Third, was built as a company home by the American Rio Grande Company (ARGLI).  The architecture is similar to the Mercedes Hotel which was constructed concurrently by ARGLI in 1906.  Company president S.P. Silver occupied  it until his own home across the street was completed. The home was sold to Dr. Charles Buck and was known as the Buck House for many years. [23]

Colegio Jacinto Trevino, founded to advance the inclusion of Latino culture and history in Texas public school curriculum, occupied the building from 1969 to 1974.  The college name came from the song Corrido de Jacinto Treviño,   a border ballad about a hero who battles injustice. The college closed after 5 years due to internal disputes. The building burned down and was demolished in 1977.

Silver, president of the American Rio Grande Irrigation and Land Company, built this Mercedes home for his family after first occupying the company home across the street. [23] In later years, the home was occupied by Dr Johnson and his family.  The smaller building on the lower right was originally horse stables, then a hospital in the mid 1930s, and eventually became the Caballero Clinic as which it continues to this day.

The arches, parapet facade and tile roof are characteristic of the Mission Revival style which was popular during that time.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5184/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/E015.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/L119.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">L119 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Later View of S.P.

Silver, a prominent early resident, shows that the second story front porch has been enclosed.  [23] The house still stands today at the southwest corner of 2nd and Missouri Streets and is part of the Mercedes Historic District. A stucco wall now surrounds the home, making it difficult to view from the street. The Amzi Stuart home is on the left. It and several others in Mercedes were built from Aladdin home kits.

Not visible in this postcard street on the East side of the 300 block of  Missouri streets were homes then owned by Dr. Cabellero, Dr. Caldera, and two homes owned by the Hernandez family of Tuluca Ranch. Three of these original homes still stand today.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5354/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/L119.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/O104.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">O104 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Century Old Homes of the  Mercedes Historic District </strong></font><font color="#414141">1917 </font><br><br><p1>Over a century has passed since these three homes were built in Mercedes, but they are still standing today in the Mercedes Historic District.  305 Missouri was built by bank president S.P. Silver as his family home.   325 Missouri was built by Amzi Stuart, an early Mercedes  land developer who owned many properties including the State Theater.  327 Missouri home was originally built to entertain prospective land buyers.  The home has been recently handsomely restored by its current owner.

The home served as the manse (minister's home) for the First Presbyterian Church at one time. It has a stucco exterior of a color similar to the Graham School, which was constructed during the same period. Although it does not have a tile roof, the Spanish Colonial style facade can be seen on the right side.  Look closely to see a man sitting on one of the front porch chairs. The address of the home is unknown and it is not clear whether the house is still standing today.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5370/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/H001.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/U010.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">U010 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Alladin Kit Home Residence of Ed Hiel, Mercedes Texas </strong></font><font color="#414141">1913 </font><br><br><p1>Woman standing in front of the farm home of early Mercedes settler Ed Hiehl in 1913.

It is possible that these homes were Aladdin Kit Home bungalows built in the early 20th century in Mercedes. The homes were ordered from a catalog and assembled upon arrival. These homes feature pyramid shaped four sided roofs, white porch columns, dormer windows, closely resembling the Denver Model in the 1915 Aladdin catalog.

It is a brick structure with a stucco overlay, and features the  arches and an inner court yard. Each side of the home is crowned by a  Mission Revival style parapet. Other Mission Revival features are the stucco exterior and the soft arches.

Note the windmill peeking over the roof in the center of the home.  The home still stands on the southern end of Capisallo Street, across from the main canal. For many years, there was rumored to be door in the home connecting to  a tunnel which ran all way to the to the Rio Grande River and Mexico.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5314/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/E018.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap-subjects"><img src="imagesColorized/R019.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">R019 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Prarie School Home Features Strong Horizontal Lines </strong></font><font color="#414141">1920 </font><br><br><p1>This home near Mercedes was built as a clubhouse to entertain potential land investors by Robert Ferry Stuart, a land developer.  The home resembles the  Spokane Model Aladdin Home which was introduced in the 1920 catalog. The Prairie School influence is evident in the Foursquare Spokane Kit Home. The home features a pyramidal roof, and there is a strong horizontal line in the wide, boxed eaves and stucco and lapped siding. The wide front porch carries the line as well.[39][40]</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5467/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/R019.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div id="flexHeader"><p2>Jacales, Spanish Colonial, and Mission Revival Style Homes Were Found in Mercedes<br><br><a href=index.html class="button" target="_blank">Home</a></p2></div><div id="flexHeader"></div><br></body></html>

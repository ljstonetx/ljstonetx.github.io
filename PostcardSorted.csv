U001,SMU,5543,5,Mercedes Produced The First Bale in the United States,Agriculture,1910,"During the early 1900s, Hidalgo was consistently a top cotton producing county in Texas. Mercedes frequently ginned the first cotton brought to market for the season, resulting in the highest prices for the farmers.  An article  about Rio Grande Valley agriculture stated 'cotton acreage peaked in 1951 after a January freeze nearly wiped out citrus...Officially, the acreage was 880,700 acres, but some estimate it closer to 1 million acres...Lately, cotton averages about 100,000 acres.  And the number of active gins has declined from 107 gins in 1952 to about 10 today...Poor market prices and the higher cost of cotton production in the U.S. as compared to China and other countries have forced many Rio Grande Valley farmers to change the crops they grow.'

The Stokely Brothers had plants throughout the United States. Grapefruit originated as a natural hybrid between a Jamaican sweet orange and the Indonesian pomelo. In 1929 a Texas citrus grower discovered a mutated red grapefruit growing on a pink grapefruit tree, which became the Ruby Red variety. [1][24]

Stokely-Van Camp is the successor to Van Camp Packing Company, an Indianapolis packer founded in 1861, and Stokely Brothers and Company, a Newport, Tennessee, canning firm founded in 1898. The Stokely Brothers plant in Mercedes operated for 50 years, from about 1940 to 1990.

According to the card inscription, the market price for cabbage was $45 per ton at the time, and the shipping season was from February to April. The Rio Grande Valley had a year-round growing season, but transportation to Northern markets was limited because produce would spoil. Cabbage and onions, which could be transported long distances without refrigeration, were the first winter vegetable crops cultivated in the valley. Refrigerated rail cars became more widely available in the 1920s, and refrigerated trucks in the 1930s, allowing Mercedes farmers to produce and market a wider variety of fruits and vegetables.

The white cloud trailing the plane is a stream of insecticide. Crop dusting was first used in the Rio Grande Valley in 1928. After World War II, thousands of pilots were released from the military. Many wanted to continue flying, but few had airplanes. Some innovative pilots started aerial crop dusting businesses, which grew rapidly. Lloyd Nolen of Mercedes was one of them, running his business out of Central Valley Airport outside of Mercedes. Crop dusting became widely utilized for pest control in Valley orchards and fields.

Q013,SMU,5495,110,Promotional Brochure Lures Farmers to the Mercedes to Grow Grapes,Agriculture,1916,"The W. E. Steward Land Company was one of several land development companies in the Mercedes area. The company brochure claimed  that the Valley produces fine, large grapes that mature six weeks ahead of California grapes and are 1,500 miles closer to the Eastern market, which assures farmers of good prices.

It also claimed the Valley is the only place in the country where grapes, potatoes, vegetables, oranges, lemons, peaches, berries, grapefruit, alfalfa, cotton, sugar cane, and corn can be grown in the same field. Like many land developers, the W. E. Steward Land Company exaggerated these points to attract farmers. [35]",

Limited acreages of citrus were established in the Mercedes and the RGV in the late 1920s and into the 1930s. This marked the beginning of the Texas citrus industry, which reached a peak of more than 100,000 acres in the 1940s. The varieties of citrus that originated in the Valley established Texas' reputation for quality citrus production. [80]",
O001,SMU,5309,130,Citrus Trees Take Five Years to Mature and Produce Fruit,Agriculture,1937,"It takes about 5 years for a citrus tree to begin producing fruit. Once the tree finally begins producing fruit, they about 6 months to ripen. The Texas citrus industry is mostly in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, with about 85 percent of the acreage in Hidalgo County. 

The major limiting factor in Texas citrus production is the risk of freeze damage.  Citrus fruits easily freeze at 26 to 28 degrees when these temperatures occur for several hours. The costs of replanting citrus orchards following a freeze are accentuated by the costs of recapturing markets lost to competing areas during freeze recovery.  [1][24]",

Due to the economic depression of the 1930s, the Elks were unable to continue their funding, so the city assumed fiscal liability for its operations.  The name changed from the Elks Hospital to Mercedes General Hospital. It prospered for several decades, but closed in the early 1960s when the more modern Knapp Memorial Hospital opened in the neighboring community of Weslaco. The building then served as a nursing home for several years before it was demolished to make way for the high rise senior apartment complex built in the late 1960s. [66]",

R045,SMU,5483,10,"Camp LLano Grande, Minnesota National Guard Unit",Camp Llano Grande,1916,"Camp Llano Grande was located near Mercedes and about five miles from the Rio Grande on a flat 200-acre site. It was served by a rail line and had a flag depot, but other than the main house, which became the camp hospital, and an old ranch house that became camp headquarters, there was little else in place when troops  first arrived. 

Their arrival precipitated a flurry of activity. Company areas were laid out, ditches dug for drainage, and brush cleared; latrines dug; incinerators erected; water pipes laid and buried. Structures were erected for kitchens and mess halls. Small wooden houses were built for officers, and platforms were built to keep the soldiers' tents off the ground. [90]",
R042,SMU,5487,20,Camp Llano Grande Main Headquarters,Camp Llano Grande,1916,"The Camp Headquarters was also the residence of the National Guard Commander. Llano Grande was the name given to the land when it was granted to Juan Jose Ynojosa de Balli  by the Spanish Crown in the late 18th Century. The area was once overed in grasslands, or llano, and was large, or grande.[13]

In an interview with early resident Lorraine Kennedy, she recalled that her Grandfather, O.J. 'Red' Schaeffer, was a jitney driver at Camp Llano Grande. In 1918 the Mercedes City Council passed an ordinance making it illegal to speak German, or to use German in advertising, preaching, lecturing and entertaining.  As the child of immigrants who grew up speaking German, this language policy caused him great distress. [23]",

Soldiers from Indiana, Minnesota and North Dakota were stationed at the camp from 1916 - 1917.  The postcard depicts soldiers shaving and washing up at the water  spigot. Upon the onset or World War I,  the camp merged with Camp Mercedes to train soldiers for service in France. [13] [90]

In this 1940s image the park has a larger, new bandstand. The Canary Island Palms are mature and there are no native Sabals to be seen. The park was a favorite gathering place in its early days. However, as automobiles became more popular, people drove to other places for entertainment, and the park had become neglected and ignored by the 1950s.",
C004,SMU,5186,70,What Became of Mercedes City Park and the Band Stand?,City Park,1928,"On March 14, 1950, the city of Mercedes auctioned off the park land for $31,000 to Lloyd and Elmer Bentsen for commercial development. The lovely park was replaced by a gas station, Ferg's Foodland grocery, and Anthony's Department Store. [31] Lloyd Bentsen later became a four-term United States Senator (1971–1993) Texas and the Democratic Party nominee for vice president in 1988.   

G.G. Garcia, an early resident of Mercedes, became the city secretary in 1968. He recalls finding documents revealing that the city had the option to reclaim the park land from the Bentsens after 20 years, but the option had expired in April 1968, three months before he was appointed city secretary. The bandstand in the park sat on private property for many years, discarded like many other treasures of Mexican culture and the past. [92]",

The first irrigation pump station powered by electricity in the valley was built in Mercedes and began operations in 1908. The electrical power was transmitted from the Mercedes Power Plant located eight miles to the north in the town. 

The pumps at the Mercedes irrigation pump station measured 36 inches in diameter, the largest in the world at that time. They pumped 300 thousand gallons of water per minute from the Rio Grande River into the Mercedes Main Canal. [24]
",
E007,SMU,5168,20,"Mercedes Irrigation Pump Plant,  View of Outlet from Main Pump",Irrigation,1912,"This postcard shows water flowing from the outlet of the Mercedes Irrigation Pump Plant station and entering the Mercedes Main Canal.  From there the water flows North by gravity to provide agricultural irrigation water for farms and citrus orchards.  By 1920, the Mercedes irrigation system had grown to three major canals and many miles of canal branches. [6] The American Rio Grande Irrigation & Land Company built the Mercedes Power Plant, the Irrigation Pump Plant and the entire canal system in the Mercedes area.  [24]",
B004,SMU,5177,30,Dredging the Mercedes Main Canal,Irrigation,1906,"On May 1, 1906, the American Rio Grande Irrigation and Land Company began dredging the Mercedes Main Canal. It took over five hundred men and three hundred mule teams to carve the canal from a stretch of land seven miles long between the Rio Grande River and the Mercedes Electric Power Station. [24]

According to an article published by the Development Corporation of Mercedes, 'The hard and back-breaking work of laborers who cleared the brush, dug the canals and its branches, made the drawings of the engineers come to life and form the basis of what for over 50 years would define the economy of Mercedes and the Rio Grande Valley.' [8]",
B005,SMU,5170,40,Children Working on Mercedes Main Canal Dredging,Irrigation,1906,"There were no child labor laws in the early part of the century.  Many children worked on the Meredes canal dredging project.  Here a group of children pose, some barefoot, with their buckets and crude tools in front of a mule team.  Today in 2023, the Mercedes canal system continues to supply local irrigation water for farms and orchards, a testament to these children and others who labored to build it over a century ago.",
J001,SMU,5329,50,Engineers Constructed a Syphon Shaped Conduit Under the El Fusti Ravine,Irrigation,1907,"Building the El Fusti Syphon was the most difficult engineering challenge of the Mercedes Main Canal irrigation project, which was financed by the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company. In this postcard image, engineers and workers stand proudly in front of the El Fusti Syphon.  During the rainy season, the El Fusti Ravine was the main drainage artery into the Arroyo Colorado for the Mercedes area.  Building the Main Canal across the ravine would have interfered with this drainage.

The engineers designed and constructed a concrete conduit in the shape of an inverted siphon to channel the canal under the ravine. One of the first projects in Texas to utilize concrete, the El Fusti project was completed in 1914.  the syphon  consisted of a 42-foot-diameter, 1,200-foot-long concrete pipe embedded with wooden support beams. [22]  ",
J002,SMU,5367,60,Construction of the El Fusti Syphon Was An Engineering Challenge,Irrigation,1907,"When completed, this El Fusti Syphon 'consisted of four pipes, each eight feet in diameter, leaving the canal by flood gates, south of the ravine, and dipping downward to avoid the bed of the ravine and rising again to practically the same level, enter the canal on the north side six hundred feet from the starting point.' [22] 

The El Fusti Syphon was located south of Mercedes, just west of where the main canal  passes through the Arroyo Colorodo. The name El Fusti originated with the Fusti Ranch, which was owned by hiers of Spanish land grantees Ynojosa de Ballí. El Fusti was a ravine which drained the ranch and surrounding area into the Arroyo Colorado. ",
E002,SMU,5164,70,El Fusti Syphon - Concrete Drain Under Mercedes Main Canal,Irrigation,1914,"The American Irrigation and Land Company introduced the use of concrete in canal construction in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Concrete was a key technological advance in the construction of many canal components, including head gates, siphons, drains, and flumes.  The use of concrete allowed for the construction of larger and more complex canals than would have been possible with other materials. This, in turn, allowed for the irrigation of more land and the production of more crops. The use of concrete also made the canals more durable, which reduced the need for maintenance and repairs. The introduction of concrete  had a significant impact on the development of the lower Rio Grande Valley.

The main water intake, located on the far left, lifed water from the river into the plant. The irrigation pump plant is still in operation today.  The pumps installed in the early days have been replaced with modern ones, and the building has also been modernized. [24]",
E003,SMU,5151,90,Mercedes Main Canal Looking North from Power House,Irrigation,1914,"This image of the Mercedes Main Canal was taken from the Mercedes Power Station near the intersection of North Illinois and North Capisallo streets. Look closely to see the outlet channeling water under the railroad tracks. This layout has not changed much in over 100 years. The Electric Power Plant structure is still standing in Mercedes, but it is no longer in use. The Main Canal, on the other hand, is still in use, providing water for agriculture in the Mercedes area. It now extends north for about 14 miles from the Rio Grande River.[24]",
C002,SMU,5185,100,Mercedes Irrigation Pump Plant. View from Road,Irrigation,1928,"The Mercedes irrigation plant's large pumps lifted water out of the Rio Grande River. Gravity then propelled the water through the Main Canal and then on to agricultural fields. When the plant was first built in 1906, gasoline powered vehicles such as trucks and cars were not available. Materials for the plant were transported by a small railroad spur  and by  horses. In this photograph taken about 20 years after construction of the pump station there is a unpaved road and a car on the left.",

R012,SMU,5479,110,Mercedes Canal System Was First to Use Man-Made Rock in Texas,Irrigation,1906,"Flumes are enclosed structures used to carry water over ravines or floodways. This concrete flume was built to carry Mercedes Main Canal water over the  Arroyo Colorado. It was the largest flume in the canal system.  The American Irrigation and Land Company was the first company in Texas to utilize concrete, or man-made rock as it was called by some.[24]",
G003,SMU,5363,120,Flume Channeled Mercedes Main Canal Across Arroyo Colorado,Irrigation,1928,"This postcard image is a later view of the large concrete flume that was constructed to channel the Mercedes Main Canal over the Arroyo Colorado. The floodway is full of water in this image, and the flume is visible. Look closely to see five men standing on the flume just to the right of center, and a man in a rowboat in the middle. The location of this flume, and whether it is still standing today, is unknown. It is likely that it was located over the floodway on 2nd Street, heading west out of Mercedes.",
E013,SMU,5189,130,Rio Grande River Was Wider and Deeper Before Irrigation,Irrigation,1909,"From the mid-1700s to the early 1900s, steamboats transported passengers and goods on the Rio Grande River. As irrigation for large-scale agricultural production increased, the river volume decreased to such an extent that steamboat transportation became impracticable.  The last riverboat navigated the Rio Grande around 1909. [78]

Today more than 15 dams and diversions have reduced the river flow to a fraction of what it used to be.  The Rio Grande Regional Water Authority coordinates allocation of the river waters. The agency was created by the Texas Legislature in 2003 as a conservation and reclamation district 'to serve a public use and benefit' by bringing together regional water interests to accomplish projects and services within Willacy, Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, Zapata, and Webb counties.[24]",
E014,SMU,5167,140,Bridge on Military Highway across the Mercedes Main Canal,Irrigation,1909,"The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built this five-arch reinforced concrete bridge over the Mercedes Main Canal on the Military Highway in the early 1900s. It cost several thousand dollars to build, a large sum at the time. [24] Look closely to see a horse-drawn carriage with three passengers crossing the bridge.  

Today, the Military Highway is part of Highway 281. The main canal has been channeled under the highway, and the bridge pictured here was demolished many years ago. ",
D005,SMU,5194,150,Mercedes Main Canal and Electric Power Plant,Irrigation,1920,"This view of the Electric Power Station with the large smokestack  was taken from the East side of Mercedes Main Canal. The canal was originally dug to be 90 to 120 feet wide at some points and from 15 to 20 feet deep. The canal still provides irrigation today, more than 100 years after its construction. [24]",
O002,SMU,5312,170,Lining Canals with Concrete Began in Mid 1920s,Irrigation,1937,"The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built branch canals called laterals to channel water to new fields as farmers bought additional land further from the Mercedes Main Canal. Laterals were built as needed to reach farmland as it was sold. The overall design and function of the irrigation system was inefficient because land was sold to farmers in scattered parcels wherever they wanted to buy it.

Concrete was used for many irrigation components such as pipes and drains at the beginning of the irrigation project, but canals were not fully lined with concrete until 1928. This greatly reduced water loss to seepage. Many of the original canals, both lined and unlined, are still in use today in Mercedes and the surrounding area.[24]",
B010,SMU,5190,10,Mercedes Hotel  Construction Completed and  Opened to Public in 1906,Mercedes Hotel,1907,"This is an early view of Mercedes Hotel with well dressed people relaxing in front. The streets surrounding the hotel are still unpaved. Mercedes Hotel was one of the first buildings constructed in the new town. Its construction started in 1905. Before the hotel was built, no housing was available, so the engineers, railroad men and others who came to the new town had to  live in boxcars or tents. The front of the hotel faced Texas Avenue and the back faced Missouri Avenue,  between 2nd Street (Business Highway 83) and 3rd Street. [27] 

In his book, Mercedes author and historian G.G. Garcia wrote: 'Across the street from the Mercedes City Park was the old hotel...where the bank Mercedes Bank now does business, a painting in the lobby the sole reminder [of the hotel] ... My grandfather, Lorenzo Gutierrez worked in the landmark hotel'. [92]",
B009,SMU,5162,20,Gulf Coast Magazine  in 1906 Featured the Mercedes Hotel,Mercedes Hotel,1907,"An article written in 1906 described the newly constructed Mercedes Hotel 'Over there, a short hundred yards south of the railroad, is a modern, cosmopolitan hotel, built of brick and finished in stucco, in the quaint, fascinating style of the old missions. This hostelry, electric lighted and equipped with every modern convenience, will be equal to any in Texas. It is now open to the public. Just west of the hotel is the imposing residence of Mr. S. P. Silver, the general manager of the company.' [22]  

The hotel had a few Mission Style features, such as the stucco exterior and the soft arches over each window. However, it was overall more like a Southern antebellum home with its Greek Revival columns, a wraparound porch, evenly spaced large windows, and large central entrances at the front and back. [52]",
R002,SMU,5466,30,Mercedes Hotel Was Located At Texas Avenue and 2nd Street,Mercedes Hotel,1907,"For many years, the local newspaper published reports of receptions, social events, and business meetings held at the hotel. In addition, the newspaper featured a weekly list of the guests staying at the hotel.  

For example, on April 29, 1915 the Mercedes Tribune reported 'Thursday afternoon Quentin Lacy entertained a few of his girl and boy friends from 4:30 to 6:00 at the hotel.  Thursday evening Miss Nell Lacy delightfully entertained her girl friends at 8 this evening at her home, the Mercedes Hotel.'",

There are stone arches above the windows on the first floor, and there is a stone foundation and possibly a basement. There are at least eight chimneys, indicating that each hotel suite probably had its own fireplace. Fireplaces would have been the primary source of heat, as gas and electric heat were not available when the hotel was built.",
R046,SMU,5462,50,"Mercedes Hotel, Mercedes, Texas",Mercedes Hotel,1907,"This postcard shows Mercedes Hotel from the corner of 2nd Street and Texas Avenue. The large wrap around porches helped keep the rooms cool in the summer heat. The hotel also had nine chimneys for the large fireplaces which supplied heat in the winter.  Later renovations to the hotel in the 40s added gas heat, but the hotel was never air conditioned.  Local newspaper ads for the hotel showed that rooms were rented by the day or week.  Also, the ads say the hotel restaurant served meals were served to hotel guests and the general public.",
N001,SMU,5353,60,Mercedes Hotel Was Vital to Mercedes Business and Social Life,Mercedes Hotel,1916,"Mercedes Hotel opened in 1906 and was one of the first buildings constructed in the new town. For  several decades it was the center of Mercedes business and social life.  The hotel changed ownership several times during its 45 year history before being demolished in the early 1950s, a victim of consumer preference for motels with modern amenities such as parking and kitchenettes.

This early view shows women strolling the hotel grounds in elegant 1920s fashions. The image was produced using the Colortone printing technique which colorizes black-and-white photographs. The women appear to have been superimposed onto the original photograph.

Its final owner was the Hotel Supply Company, which ordered its closing in late 1951. In February 1952, the hotel and its furnishings were sold to separate buyers. L.S. Blunt of Mercedes bought the land for $39,000, J.F. Riley of Mercedes bought the building for $1,000, and various buyers purchased the furnishings for a total of $1,447. Blunt announced that he planned to sell the land to an oil company for a gas station. [32] 

The hotel was demolished shortly thereafter. The Bazaar Gas Station occupied the western portion of the hotel's former site for many years. Today, a bank and parking lot stand on the site of this once-grand hotel.",

One side of the road landscape is natural and uncleared, suitable for ranching, while on the other side land is fenced and cleared for farmland and dotted by telephone poles. The image illustrates the transition from generations of traditional ranching and land ownership to the loss of heritage and land to large scale agricultural production.

Ranches sprouted and flourished in the mid-1700s because of Jose de Escandón, a Spaniard sent to the area by Spanish authorities in Mexico City.

The homes were supported by upright poles and forked horcones (corner posts). Smaller mesquite limbs were placed horizontally across the poles with clay  or stucco between them. Roofs were thatched from native grasses. [28]

Many ranches had access to water from the Rio Grande River or one of the inland resacas (lakes). However, those that did not had to dig wells to provide fresh water for agriculture and household use. This water was often brackish and not suitable for drinking. 

As a result, vendors known as piperos filled barrels with fresh drinking water from good wells or the Rio Grande River and delivered it to homes using mule-drawn wagons. This was a vital service that ensured that people had access to clean water in the dry conditions. [28]",

The area around Mercedes was well suited for ranching. It was was too dry to grow large quantities of crops prior to the introduction of irrigation[1]. 

Before the arrival of the railroad in 1905, much of the livestock ranching trade in the American Southwest was with Mexico.

The railroad made it possible to ship goods more quickly and cheaply to the interior United States, one of the many factors which led to a decline in the livestock ranching trade with Mexico.",

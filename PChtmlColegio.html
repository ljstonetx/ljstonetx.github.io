The speaking engagement would be confrontational. Like Daniel I was walking into the lions den.They would not attack the incumbent Texas State Senator Jim Bates a Democrat. He was too glib in both languages. State Representative Raul Longoria also a democrat hardly ever showed his face during the campaign. He was using the phantom strategy - You cannot attack what you dont see. Ricardo Molina the third party candidate was running on the Raza Unida ticket. He was one of them.  So I was it.

It was located on the Northeast corner  of Texas Avenue and 5th Street.  The school served all grades from elementary to high school, The first graduating class of 1914 had only one student. In 1915, there were four graduates

The school was built in a style that combined Spanish colonial arches and stucco  with  New England features including dormers and crescent-shaped windows. There was no air conditioning but the  classrooms had windows and doors featuring transom windows to provide fresh air.

Initially referred to as the school house, the school was later named the Buck School in honor of Harriet Claycomb Buck, the mother of Nannie Buck, who was school superintendent from 1915 to 1923.

In this postcard, many of the students are dressed formally, with boys wearing ties. Perhaps the photo was taken on a special occasion, such as the last day of school. To shield themselves from the intense South Texas sun, most of the adults and children wore hats. The inscription on the reverse side of the card reads, 'I am standing on the left. Miss Bowman is seated, and the two male teachers are with the children.'</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/A008.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5166/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/R010.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">R010 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Buck School Demolished After Hurricane Damage in 1933 </strong></font><font color="#414141">1912 </font><br><br><p1>In the early days, some area ranches provided on-site schools for the children who lived there. In 1907, when Mercedes was founded, the school district provided classes in churches and other buildings. [97]  In 1912 the Buck School Building was completed. It  accommodated all grades until the high school moved into the new South School building in 1921. [27]  Even after the Buck School opened, some ranch owners continued to provide  schools for since the distance was too far to travel before automobiles were widely available.

In 1933, the Buck School was demolished due to major damage by a hurricane. All classes moved to the North and South Schools which had been constructed by then.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/R010.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5491/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/A110.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">A110 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Buck School Heated by Fireplaces and Cooled by Open Windows </strong></font><font color="#414141">1912 </font><br><br><p1>The presence of several chimneys and the absence of electrical lines suggest that fireplaces provided heating for the school.  Porches, verandas, and windows provided cooling during the warmer weather.  The purpose of the pole atop the dormer window is uncertain. It may have once been part of a weather vane, or it could simply be decorative. 

It is not known how many classrooms the school had, or whether there was a lunchroom. The school did have an auditorium used for school events. In addition, the local newspaper frequently announced civic organizations gathering at the school house auditorium, which must have been this auditorium, as no there were no others in Mercedes at the time.

There is a grass lawn, sidewalks, and the Texas Avenue in front of the school has been paved. In addition, the large post on the left side may have for electricity to provide lighting in the school.

Today little information is known today about the charming Buck School which played a crucial role in early Mercedes.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/R009.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5478/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/L001.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">L001 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Magnificent Mission Revival Style Graham School Built in 1921 </strong></font><font color="#414141">1940 </font><br><br><p1>This building was built in 1921 and was originally called South School. It was renamed after Leo R. Graham, the superintendent of Mercedes schools from 1941 to 1951, in the 1950s. The school is an outstanding example of Mission Revival architecture, with its distinctive bell tower and parapets on each front wall. It was constructed with stucco, plaster, and brick by skilled masons. As of 2023, the building remains standing, but it is in a state of disrepair and requires restoration.[27]

A second school called the North School served the children living on the North side of town. The North School was later renamed John F. Kennedy Elementary School.

The Graham School served as the high school when first built in 1921. It was converted to a grade school when the new high school was built a decade later across the street. The Spanish Revival style Gymnasium Cafeteria complex, built in 1931, was the second school in the Rio Grande 'Valley to have an indoor basketball court. The local paper boasted that 'dressing rooms for boys and girls are equipped with showers, lockers, and baskets for gymnasium suites.' These architectural gems stand today in 2023, nearly a century after their construction.

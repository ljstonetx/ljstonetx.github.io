<p3>Built in 1928 by the Elks Lodge the structure was a shining example of Mediterranean Revival architecture designed by architect R. Newell Waters. Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s the building hosted countless community events including elegant dances and concerts.</p3></div><br><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/I003.jpg"><p1><font color=#555555>I003</font>
<font color="+COLOR_TITLE"+"> <strong>Mercedes Elks Club with Elegant Ballroom Was A Popular Venue </strong></font><font color=#555555>1928</font>
<br><br><p1>The Elks Club built this Mediterranean-style building with a red tile roof, stucco exterior, and arched windows at Missouri Avenue and 2nd Street in Mercedes in 1928. It stands today but is now boarded up and abandoned. During the Great Depression, the Elks Lodge's revenues declined, and businesses began to rent office space in the building. It became the Chamber of Commerce Building in the 1940s. [64][65] When  the older Mercedes Hotel that stood at the corner of Texas and Second Street was demolished in the 1950s, this building became a hotel, and was renamed the Mercedes Hotel.  So, it often confused with the older Mercedes Hotel.</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>Looking East from Missouri Avenue and 3rd Street, this postcard features the Chamber of Commerce building that was originally built as the Elk's Lodge.  The home across the street on the right was  built and occupied for many years by Dr Caballero and his family.  Both buildings still stand today in the Mercedes Historic District.

<br><br><p1>The first of several Mercedes buildings designed by architect R. Newell Waters [4], the entrance of the Elks Club Building features ornamental brick work, a detailed arched doorway, and Mediterranean light fixtures, and a large clock above the door. There was a roof top terrace and decorative red tile. Inside, the lodge featured social rooms, library, shower baths, a ballroom and a roof garden. 

Upon completion of the building in 1928, the newspaper reported  'The building with its spacious corner lot represents a total investment of 65,000 dollars and is one of the most handsome fraternal lodge homes south of San Antonio. It is of beautiful architectural design and modern in all of its appointments. The interior has been neatly and artistically decorated and it now awaits furnishing.' [65][66] </p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>By the 1960s the building was being used as a hotel and apartments. A sign for the now air conditioned hot3le has been added. Wooden panels have been added to some windows reducing them in size. An additional structure has been added on the roof. The street lights have been removed and a traffic sign has been added at the corner.[50]</p1><br><br>

<br><br><p1>This photograph shows the back of the Elks Club Building in the 1960s. At that time it operated as the Mercedes Hotel a name it adopted after the original Mercedes Hotel on Texas Avenue was demolished. Several windows were partially boarded up with wooden panels giving the structure a more rundown and neglected appearance compared to earlier years. At this point in its history the building offered both hotel rooms and apartment accommodations.</p1><br><br>

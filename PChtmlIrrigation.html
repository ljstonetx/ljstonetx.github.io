The first irrigation pump station powered by electricity in the valley was built in Mercedes and began operations in 1908. The electrical power was transmitted from the Mercedes Power Plant located eight miles to the north in the town. 

The pumps at the Mercedes irrigation pump station measured 36 inches in diameter, the largest in the world at that time. They pumped 300 thousand gallons of water per minute from the Rio Grande River into the Mercedes Main Canal. [24]

From there the water flows North by gravity to provide agricultural irrigation water for farms and citrus orchards.  By 1920, the Mercedes irrigation system had grown to three major canals and many miles of canal branches. [6] The American Rio Grande Irrigation & Land Company built the Mercedes Power Plant, the Irrigation Pump Plant and the entire canal system in the Mercedes area.

It took over five hundred men and three hundred mule teams to carve the canal from a stretch of land seven miles long between the Rio Grande River and the Mercedes Electric Power Station. [24]

According to an article published by the Development Corporation of Mercedes, 'The hard and back-breaking work of laborers who cleared the brush, dug the canals and its branches, made the drawings of the engineers come to life and form the basis of what for over 50 years would define the economy of Mercedes and the Rio Grande Valley.'

In this postcard image, engineers and workers stand proudly in front of the El Fusti Syphon.  During the rainy season, the El Fusti Ravine was the main drainage artery into the Arroyo Colorado for the Mercedes area.  Building the Main Canal across the ravine would have interfered with this drainage.

The engineers designed and constructed a concrete conduit in the shape of an inverted siphon to channel the canal under the ravine. One of the first projects in Texas to utilize concrete, the El Fusti project was completed in 1914.  the syphon  consisted of a 42-foot-diameter, 1,200-foot-long concrete pipe embedded with wooden support beams. [22]  </p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5329/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/J001.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/J002.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">J002 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Construction of the El Fusti Syphon Was An Engineering Challenge </strong></font><font color="#414141">1907 </font><br><br><p1>When completed, this El Fusti Syphon 'consisted of four pipes, each eight feet in diameter, leaving the canal by flood gates, south of the ravine, and dipping downward to avoid the bed of the ravine and rising again to practically the same level, enter the canal on the north side six hundred feet from the starting point.' [22] 

The El Fusti Syphon was located south of Mercedes, just west of where the main canal  passes through the Arroyo Colorodo. The name El Fusti originated with the Fusti Ranch, which was owned by hiers of Spanish land grantees Ynojosa de Ball√≠. El Fusti was a ravine which drained the ranch and surrounding area into the Arroyo Colorado. </p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5367/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/J002.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/E002.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">E002 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>El Fusti Syphon - Concrete Drain Under Mercedes Main Canal </strong></font><font color="#414141">1914 </font><br><br><p1>The American Irrigation and Land Company introduced the use of concrete in canal construction in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Concrete was a key technological advance in the construction of many canal components, including head gates, siphons, drains, and flumes.  The use of concrete allowed for the construction of larger and more complex canals than would have been possible with other materials. This, in turn, allowed for the irrigation of more land and the production of more crops. The use of concrete also made the canals more durable, which reduced the need for maintenance and repairs. The introduction of concrete  had a significant impact on the development of the lower Rio Grande Valley.

When the plant was first built in 1906, gasoline powered vehicles such as trucks and cars were not available. Materials for the plant were transported by a small railroad spur  and by  horses. In this photograph taken about 20 years after construction of the pump station there is a unpaved road and a car on the left.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5185/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/C002.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/R012.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">R012 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Mercedes Canal System Was First to Use Man-Made Rock in Texas </strong></font><font color="#414141">1906 </font><br><br><p1>Flumes are enclosed structures used to carry water over ravines or floodways.

As irrigation for large-scale agricultural production increased, the river volume decreased to such an extent that steamboat transportation became impracticable.  The last riverboat navigated the Rio Grande around 1909. [78]

Today more than 15 dams and diversions have reduced the river flow to a fraction of what it used to be.  The Rio Grande Regional Water Authority coordinates allocation of the river waters. The agency was created by the Texas Legislature in 2003 as a conservation and reclamation district 'to serve a public use and benefit' by bringing together regional water interests to accomplish projects and services within Willacy, Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, Zapata, and Webb counties.[24]</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5189/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/E013.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/E014.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">E014 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Bridge on Military Highway across the Mercedes Main Canal </strong></font><font color="#414141">1909 </font><br><br><p1>The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built this five-arch reinforced concrete bridge over the Mercedes Main Canal on the Military Highway in the early 1900s.

Today, the Military Highway is part of Highway 281.

Laterals were built as needed to reach farmland as it was sold. The overall design and function of the irrigation system was inefficient because land was sold to farmers in scattered parcels wherever they wanted to buy it.

Concrete was used for many irrigation components such as pipes and drains at the beginning of the irrigation project, but canals were not fully lined with concrete until 1928. This greatly reduced water loss to seepage. Many of the original canals, both lined and unlined, are still in use today in Mercedes and the surrounding area.[24]</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5312/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/O002.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div id="flexHeader"><p2>Mercedes Irrigation System Constructed in 1907 Still Used Today<br><br><a href=index.html class="button" target="_blank">Home</a></p2></div><div id="flexHeader"></div><br></body></html>

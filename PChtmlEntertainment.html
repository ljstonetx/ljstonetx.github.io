The A-MUZ-U Theater was a popular destination.  It would have been showing silent movies as talkies  were not available until the mid 20's. Eateries such as the  Cold Milk and Pie Shop were also been popular destinations for the soldiers.

According to the Mercedes Tribune in August 1917,  soldiers from Indiana hosted an Indiana Night benefit at the A-Muz-U theater to raise money for the Camp Llano Grande YMCA building. Three home movies from Indiana were shown:  a garden dance party given by one of the soldier's cousins, the funeral of an Indiana poet, and  footage of a Indiana University vs Perdue football game.

The theater is covered with film posters and signs advertising 'Home Made Ice Cream and Very Best Lemonade.' The Western Queen, another theater, is located to the right. According to a local newspaper from 1917, there was also another theater behind the camp, the Broadway, and that 'soldiers thronged the theaters each night from the time supper mess kits are cleaned until the bugle sends them home.'  At the time, only silent movies were available. The Western Queen accompanied the movies with music, which the soldiers enjoyed very much. [47]

Prohibition did not pass until several years after this photograph was taken, but there are no bars or signs for liquor or alcohol. It is possible that speakeasies existed but did not have signs to mark their presence.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/X002.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5533/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/L007.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">L007 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>State Theater, Whiskey, Wine and Coca-Cola on Texas Avenue and 4th in the 1940s </strong></font><font color="#414141">1940 </font><br><br><p1>Looking Northeast from Texas Avenue and 4th Street in Mercedes are several businesses in buildings that are still there today. The Whiskey and Wine building was the Vogue Ladies Store for several decades. Look closely at the photograph to see  a man changing the marquee at the State Theater, which was started by Amzi Stuart. His son Herald inherited the theater and kept it open until the 1960s.  

The First National Bank was founded around 1910 and moved to the corner of Texas and 2nd in the early 1960s. The Central Power & Light and Porter Telegram businesses are next.  The Shell Gas Station across the street has a sign for 'No Knock' gas  16 cents/gallon.  The addition of lead to gasoline as an antiknock agent was recognized as a serious health hazard and banned in the United States in the 1970s.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/L007.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5320/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/Q008.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">Q008 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Bougainvillea Restaurant Was Located On US 83 and Mile 2 West </strong></font><font color="#414141">1950 </font><br><br><p1>The Mercedes Enterprise reported that the Bougainvillea Restaurant opened on Friday, October 10, 1947, and served 'Chickens, Steaks, Chops and Seafoods at all Hours.'   Mr. and Mrs. Al Strittmatter owned the restaurant which was located 'just past the highway bridge west of Mercedes'. [48] Its red tile roof, stucco exterior and Bougainvillea plant for which it was named, nodded to Mission style which was popular in the Mercedes area.

Local businesses Model Cleaning, Tullis Office Supply, Mercedes Sheet Metal Work, and Economy Plumbing took out large ads in the newspaper to welcome the new business to town. The restaurant was a popular spot for both dining and social gatherings. It closed in the 1960s and the empty building stood for many years before being demolished.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/Q008.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5496/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/W045.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">W045 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Mercedes Livestock Show Parade </strong></font><font color="#414141">1920 </font><br><br><p1>In this photo, members of the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company take part in the annual Livestock Show Parade. The earliest known reference to a livestock show in a Mercedes newspaper appeared in the Mercedes Tribune in 1914. It encouraged community participation with the advertisement: “Help demonstrate what the Lower Rio Grande Valley can do in agriculture, horticulture, and livestock by exhibiting your best products at the Rio Grande Live Stock Show and Fair at Mercedes.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/W045.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://scholarworks.utrgv.edu/hidalgohist_aa/45/ class="button">View Library</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/W040.jpg"><p1><font color="#414141">W040 </font><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Rio Grande Valley Livestock Show </strong></font><font color="#414141">1942 </font><br><br><p1>Ranchers showing bulls at 1942 Rio Grande Valley Livestock Show and Agricultural Exposition.

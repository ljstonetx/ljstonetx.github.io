The A-MUZ-U Theater was a popular destination.  It would have been showing silent movies as talkies  were not available until the mid 20's. Eateries such as the  Cold Milk and Pie Shop must have also been popular destinations for the soldiers.

According to the Mercedes Tribune in August 1917,  soldiers from Indiana hosted an Indiana Night benefit at the A-Muz-U theater to raise money for the Camp Llano Grande YMCA building. Three home movies from Indiana were shown:  a garden dance party given by one of the soldier's cousins, the funeral of an Indiana poet, and  footage of a Indiana University vs Perdue football game.

The theater is covered with film posters and signs advertising 'Home Made Ice Cream and Very Best Lemonade.' The Western Queen, another theater, is located to the right. According to a local newspaper from 1917, there was also another theater behind the camp, the Broadway, and that 'soldiers thronged the theaters each night from the time supper mess kits are cleaned until the bugle sends them home.'  At the time, only silent movies were available. The Western Queen accompanied the movies with music, which the soldiers enjoyed very much. [47]

Prohibition did not pass until several years after this photograph was taken, but there are no bars or signs for liquor or alcohol. It is possible that speakeasies existed but did not have signs to mark their presence.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/X002.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5533/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/Q007.jpg"><p1><font color="grey"> Q007</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Stewart Club House Was On Beautiful Resaca Southeast of Mercedes </strong></font><font color="grey">1920 </font><br><p1>The Stewart Club House was one of many clubhouses Mercedes land developers built to entertain customers during the early 1900s.  It was located on Llano Grande Lake near Mercedes. The lake is now known as Progresso Lake and the Club House no longer stands.  The lake is actually a resaca, an arm of the Rio Grande River that became isolated when the river changed course.

The W.E. Stewart Land Company promotional brochure lured buyers with this exaggerated description: 'This is where the Stewart Land Co. entertain their excursions parties while in the Rio Grande Valley.  Beautiful Rio Grande Lake is long and deep, its banks overshadowed with trees. The slopes are covered with sweet scented wildflowers, and fishing provides a profitable pastime'.

In 1913, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company acquired a significant portion of the Llano Grande grant and developed the West Tract. [35] In 1916, the United States government stationed troops along the Rio Grande to control raids from Mexico and established a camp at the Llano Grande railroad depot, near Mercedes. The guardsmen erected a watchtower at Progreso. On December 14, 1917, the irrigation company sold 30,000 acres at 90 dollars per acre to the W. E. Stewart Land Company.

Construction began in 1928. The structure was built of hollow tile covered with stucco, with a Spanish tile roof and reinforced concrete foundation. A tower was located on the west side, and the first floor contained a ladies' parlor, men's locker rooms, and showers. The club house was finished inside and out with native wood.  According to the local newspaper, the club house was 'situated on the banks of the Llano Grande Lake in one of the most beautiful spots in the Valley.' [57]

The building later became a residence for Harold Lehman. Today the clubhouse serves as offices for the Llano Grande Lake Park Resort.

[48] Its red tile roof, stucco exterior and Bougainvillea plant for which it was named, nodded to Mission style which was popular in the Mercedes area.

Local businesses Model Cleaning, Tullis Office Supply, Mercedes Sheet Metal Work, and Economy Plumbing took out large ads in the newspaper to welcome the new business to town. The restaurant was a popular spot for both dining and social gatherings. It closed in the 1960s and the empty building stood for many years before being demolished.</p1><br><br><a href=imagesColorized/Q008.jpg>View Enlarged</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5496/>View High Resolution</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/K002.jpg"><p1><font color="grey"> K002</font> <font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Cover Girl Contestants, RGV Livestock Show of Mercedes </strong></font><font color="grey">1955 </font><br><p1>The  earliest mention of a livestock show in a Mercedes newspaper appeared in the Mercedes Tribune in 1914: Help demonstrate what the Lower Rio Grande Valley can do in agriculture, horticulture, and livestock by exhibiting your best products at the Rio Grande Live Stock Show and Fair at Mercedes, October 8, 9, and 10...

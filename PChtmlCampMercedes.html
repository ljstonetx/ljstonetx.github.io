Pershing </strong></font><font color="#414141">1917 </font><br><br><p1>General John J. Pershing chose Mercedes as the site for a permanent training camp when the United States entered WW1 in 1916. Construction of Camp Mercedes on a 80-acre tract southeast of town was completed in early 1917.  Until the WWI recruits arrived,  a 16th Cavalry training cadre occupied the camp. The soldiers who later arrived for WWI training specialized in the management of horses for service in France. At its peak,  Camp Mercedes hosted 16 officers, 700 enlisted men and 600 horses. After the armistice, the camp was demobilized and closed in 1922. [84]

During the WWI period,  cavalry troops from Fort Brown camped in the park during joint training exercises. [82]

World War I was the last major conflict in which cavalry (horse) units were used extensively. Once considered essential offensive elements of a military force, the vulnerability of horses to modern weapons reduced their utility on the battlefield.

The camp included a laundry and a mess hall, a movie theater and a YMCA building. A bakery provided fresh bread every day.  Religious services were conducted every Sunday. Some homes stall standing on Iowa Street in Mercedes were originally officer housing.[83]

The theater was open to the general public as well as soldiers. The schedule, according to the March 1918 newspaper,  was: Saturday: Douglas Fairbanks in The Good Bad Man, Sunday: They're Off, Monday: Serial -- The Hidden Hand (8th episode), Grip of Evil (4th episode). Adults: 10 cents Children: 5 cents. Musical accompaniment by the 16th Cavalry Band.

Two children are seated with them. On April 30, 1916, soldiers had been fired on from across the Mexican border. Despite 150 rounds being exchanged, none of the American soldiers were injured. It was feared that the pump station would be a likely target for continuing raids from across the border.

In an effort to curb the spread of the Spanish Flu, officers issued an order banning Camp Mercedes soldiers from attending picture shows and public gatherings during the epidemic.  'A reappearance of influenza at some of the border posts led to the order and to other precautionary measures.  No cases have been reported at the camp and with the continuation of fair weather it is believed that the picture show ban will be lifted next week.'

The camp was located at what is now 10th and Florida Streets in Mercedes, Texas.  Camp Mercedes and Camp Llano Grande, located outside the town, were home to 15,000 soldiers during World War I.

He was told that his grandfather worked in 'el quartel' - the soldiers barracks - that were southeast of town. [92]

The local newspaper reported on their visit: 'Company L, Second Texas Infantry was organized in 1915. First active service when called out May 1916 and sent to the Mexican border, remaining until mustered out in March 23, 1917. Called into service again April 1, 1917. The company totals officers and men, 147.  The picture shows them in firing position and was posed in front of El Parado del Amor, one of the pretty parks in Mercedes.' [87]  Mercedes City Park was known by locals as 'El Parado del Amor, which translates to The Stop of Love, perhaps a reference to the adjacency of the park to the train station.</p1><br><br><a href=https://digitalcollections.smu.edu/digital/collection/tex/id/5540/ class="button">View High Resolution</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=imagesColorized/U015.jpg class="button">View Enlarged</a><br><br></div><div id="flexHeader"><p2>Camp Mercedes Was World War 1 Training Camp"<br><br><a href=index.html class="button" target="_blank">Home</a></p2></div><div id="flexHeader"></div><br></body></html>

Pershing </strong></font><font color="grey">1917 </font><br><p1>General John J. Pershing chose Mercedes as the site for a permanent training camp when the United States entered WW1 in 1916. Construction of Camp Mercedes on a 80-acre tract southeast of town was completed in early 1917.  Until the WWI recruits arrived,  a 16th Cavalry training cadre occupied the camp. The soldiers who later arrived for WWI training specialized in the management of horses for service in France. At its peak,  Camp Mercedes hosted 16 officers, 700 enlisted men and 600 horses. After the armistice, the camp was demobilized and closed in 1922. [84]

During the WWI period,  cavalry troops from Fort Brown camped in the park during joint training exercises. [82]

World War I was the last major conflict in which cavalry (horse) units were used extensively. Once considered essential offensive elements of a military force, the vulnerability of horses to modern weapons reduced their utility on the battlefield.

The camp included a laundry and a mess hall, a movie theater and a YMCA building. A bakery provided fresh bread every day.  Religious services were conducted every Sunday. Some homes stall standing on Iowa Street in Mercedes were originally officer housing.[83]

The theater was open to the general public as well as soldiers. The schedule, according to the March 1918 newspaper,  was: Saturday: Douglas Fairbanks in The Good Bad Man, Sunday: They're Off, Monday: Serial -- The Hidden Hand (8th episode), Grip of Evil (4th episode).

It was feared that the pump station would be a likely target for continuing raids from across the border.

In an effort to curb the spread of the Spanish Flu, officers issued an order banning Camp Mercedes soldiers from attending picture shows and public gatherings during the epidemic.  'A reappearance of influenza at some of the border posts led to the order and to other precautionary measures.  No cases have been reported at the camp and with the continuation of fair weather it is believed that the picture show ban will be lifted next week.'

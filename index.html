The Fusti Ranch was owned by the heirs of Spanish land grantee Ynojosa de Ballí. The ravine that drained the ranch and the surrounding area into the Arroyo Colorado was referred to as El Fuste. During construction of the Mercedes Main Canal in 1907 the structure built across the ravine was called the El Fuste Syphon. Later the  neighborhood that developed on the land was called El Fuste.  Resident efforts to incorporate  as the city of El Fueste were unsuccessful and the neighborhood was annexed by Mercedes in 1960.

No longer clearly part of either the United States or Mexico Río Rico became a lawless territory where gambling dance halls and saloons flourished. The saloons and gambling are long gone but the small community of Rio Rico remains across the border 7 miles south of Mercedes.</p1><br><br><a href=PChtmlRioRico.html>View Rio Rico</a></div><div class="flex-wrap"><img src="imagesColorized/L001.jpg"><p1><font color="#cc0000"> <strong>Schools Buildings in Mercedes, Ohio Street Are Architecturally Significant </strong></font><br><p1>The first public school in Mercedes, known as Buck School, has since faded from memory.

The Fusti Ranch was originally owned by the heirs of Spanish land grantee Ynojosa de BallÃ­. A ravine that drained the ranch and surrounding area into the Arroyo Colorado became known as El Fuste.

In 1907, during the construction of the Mercedes Main Canal, a structure built across this ravine was named the El Fuste Syphon. Over time, a neighborhood grew on the land once part of the ranch, and it too came to be called El Fuste.

Residents later attempted to incorporate the area as a separate city under the name El Fueste, but these efforts were unsuccessful. In 1960, the neighborhood was officially annexed by the city of Mercedes.

At various points in time, El Fuste has referred to a ranch, a ravine, a concrete drain, a neighborhood, and even a proposed cityâ€”highlighting its deep-rooted connection to the region's history.</p1><br><br>

In July 1906 the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built a cutoff to direct the river into a more direct course. As a result RÃ­o Rico came to be located south of the border in Mexico. No longer clearly part of either the United States or Mexico RÃ­o Rico became a lawless territory where gambling dance halls and saloons flourished. The saloons and gambling are long gone but the small community of Rio Rico remains across the border 7 miles south of Mercedes.</p1><br><br>

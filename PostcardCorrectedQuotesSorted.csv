U001,5543,5,1910 Mercedes Produced The First Bale in the United States,Agriculture,1910,"During the early 1900s, Hidalgo was consistently a top cotton producing county in Texas. Mercedes frequently ginned the first cotton brought to market for the season, resulting in the highest prices for the farmers.  An article  about Rio Grande Valley agriculture stated 'cotton acreage peaked in 1951 after a January freeze nearly wiped out citrus...Officially, the acreage was 880,700 acres, but some estimate it closer to 1 million acres...Lately, cotton averages about 100,000 acres.  And the number of active gins has declined from 107 gins in 1952 to about 10 today...Poor market prices and the higher cost of cotton production in the U.S. as compared to China and other countries have forced many Rio Grande Valley farmers to change the crops they grow.'

The ranch had half a mile of  Rio Grande riverfront and extended north into the area that now includes Mercedes. Early descendants of Hinojosa built a large ranch house by a lake on the land. Later descendant Domiciano Cavazos set aside land for a cemetery in 1906, and many family members were buried there. The ranch was eventually sold to a developer, and Anacahuitas Lake became a popular site for recreation. Today, the Rio Grande Valley Stock Show Grounds sit on land that was once part of the Anacuitas Ranch. The historic family cemetery remains, located North of Expressway 83 in Mercedes, on west side of FM 491  (Baseline Road) where it crosses the main canal. [3] [73] "

The A-MUZ-U Theater was a popular destination.  It would have been showing silent movies as talkies  were not available until the mid 20's. Eateries such as the  Cold Milk and Pie Shop must have also been popular destinations for the soldiers.

According to the Mercedes Tribune in August 1917,  soldiers from Indiana hosted an Indiana Night benefit at the A-Muz-U theater to raise money for the Camp Llano Grande YMCA building.

In 1928 they replaced it with the larger hospital building in this postcard. The hospital had 12 private rooms and an open ward. The building featured a red tile roof, soft arches, and white stucco,  typical of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture at that time. In the 1930s,  the Elks Club was no longer able to sustain the hospital. The city took over and renamed it Mercedes General Hospital. It served the town of Mercedes until the 1960s. [66]

Early Mercedes physicians included Dr. Caldera, Dr De La Torre, Dr Edwards, Dr Caballero, and Dr Johnston. Dr Johnston and Dr Caballero owned their own hospital on 3rd street where their clinic still exists today.  Dr. Hector P.

J003,5374,10,,Infrastructure,1907,"The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company had a grand plan to transform the Rio Grande Valley region into an agricultural oasis. The first step was to construct an electric power plant to pump water from the Rio Grande River into irrigation canals. The plant's coal-fired steam engines began generating electricity for the pumps in 1906, and also provided power to Mercedes's homes and businesses. Mercedes was the first city within a hundred-mile radius to have electric lights. Even Brownsville, a much larger city, did not have electricity until 1908.  Gulf Coast magazine wrote in 1906 these words.  Within the electric power station's four massive walls are housed the four great engines that will provide the power for the stupendous irrigation scheme that is the foundation of the company's activity, and the various and varied activities that will surely follow in later years.

B001,5173,10,Gambling and Vice Flourished In Rio Rico Near Mercedes Pumping Station,Events,1907,"This postcard depicts a crowd watching a cockfight in the rough and tumble community of Rio Rico south of Mercedes. Rio Rico was originally located north of the Rio Grande River on land surrounded by a bend in the river. In July 1906, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company built a cutoff to direct the river into a more direct course. As a result, Río Rico came to be located south of the border in Mexico. No longer clearly part of either the United States or Mexico, Río Rico became a lawless territory where gambling, dance halls, and saloons flourished.  The Tivoli, named after a renowned nightclub in Italy, was the first and most well-known nightclub. [43] [75] [94]"

In 1915, there were four graduates

The school was built in a style that combined Spanish colonial arches and stucco  with  New England features including dormers and crescent-shaped windows. There was no air conditioning but the  classrooms had windows and doors featuring transom windows to provide fresh air.

Initially referred to as the school house, the school was later named the Buck School in honor of Harriet Claycomb Buck, the mother of Nannie Buck, who was school superintendent from 1915 to 1923. [27]"

The streets surrounding the hotel are still unpaved. Mercedes Hotel was one of the first buildings constructed in the new town. Its construction started in 1905. Before the hotel was built, no housing was available, so the engineers, railroad men and others who came to the new town had to  live in boxcars or tents. The front of the hotel faced Texas Avenue and the back faced Missouri Avenue,  between 2nd Street (Business Highway 83) and 3rd Street. [27] 

In his book, Mercedes author and historian G.G. Garcia wrote: 'Across the street from the Mercedes City Park was the old hotel...where the bank Mercedes Bank now does business, a painting in the lobby the sole reminder [of the hotel] ... My grandfather, Lorenzo Gutierrez worked in the landmark hotel'. [92]"
B003,5157,10, Early Mercedes Construction Depended On Maestros Ladrilleros,Industry,1907,"Master brickmakers [Maestros Ladrilleros] pour clay into molds at a  brickyard [ladrillera]  located South of Mercedes, Texas. Brickmakers were skilled craftsmen who understood selection and harvesting of  clay, building molds, pouring clay, as well building wood fired kilns and firing bricks.  

Brickmaking skills were passed generationally through families. One family member described their skills: 'They all knew how to mold [haver hechura]. They knew clay, which clay to use for brick. They knew how to fire [quemar]. They knew how to set [asentrar] bricks in the kiln. They learned all that from their father'. [9]"
J004,5342,10,Group of Jacale Homes on Large Mercedes Area Ranch,Homes,1907,"Among the postcards included in this collection are examples of Jacale, Kit Homes, Spanish Colonial, and Mission Revival style homes.

This group of Jacale homes near Mercedes housed ranch workers and their families.  Jacele homes were  constructed primarily from mesquite, but also ebony and other native woods . Mesquite was abundant locally, and was strong and durable. The homes were supported by upright poles and forked horcones (corner posts). Smaller mesquite limbs were placed horizontally across with clay sealing the openings.  [28]

Traditional ranch life was thriving into the late 1800s, but jacales dwindled as traditional ranching declined thereafter. There were few Jacales left in the Mercedes area following the hurricane of 1933."
E006,5159,10,Mercedes Irrigation Pump Station Was Vanguard of Technology,Irrigation,1912,"In the early 1900s,  coal-fired steam powered all irrigation pumps in the Rio Grande Valley.  The first irrigation pump station powered by electricity in the valley was built in Mercedes and began operations in 1908. The electrical power was transmitted from the Mercedes Power Plant located eight miles to the north in the town. 

The pumps at the Mercedes irrigation pump station measured 36 inches in diameter, the largest in the world at that time. They pumped 300 thousand gallons of water per minute from the Rio Grande River into the Mercedes Main Canal. [24]

Pershing chose Mercedes as the site for a permanent training camp when the United States entered WW1 in 1916. Construction of Camp Mercedes on a 80-acre tract southeast of town was completed in early 1917.  Until the WWI recruits arrived,  a 16th Cavalry training cadre occupied the camp. The soldiers who later arrived for WWI training specialized in the management of horses for service in France. At its peak,  Camp Mercedes hosted 16 officers, 700 enlisted men and 600 horses. After the armistice, the camp was demobilized and closed in 1922. [84]

R045,R045,10,"Camp LLano Grande, Minnesota National Guard Unit",Camp Llano Grande,1916,"Camp Llano Grande was located near Mercedes and about five miles from the Rio Grande on a flat 200-acre site. It was served by a rail line and had a flag depot, but other than the main house, which became the camp’s hospital, and an old ranch house that became camp headquarters, there was little else in place when troops  first arrived. 

Their arrival precipitated a flurry of activity. Company areas were laid out, ditches dug for drainage, and brush cleared; latrines dug; incinerators erected; water pipes laid and buried. Structures were erected for kitchens and mess halls. Small wooden houses were built for officers, and platforms were built to keep the soldiers' tents off the ground. [90]"
L008,5330,11,Mercedes General Hospital Closed in the 1960s,Body and Soul,1940,"The Elks Lodge funded and  built the only hospital in Mercedes, pictured here. Due to the economic depression of the 1930s, the Elks were unable to continue their funding, so the city assumed fiscal liability for its operations.  The name changed from the Elks Hospital to Mercedes General Hospital. It prospered for several decades, but closed in the early 1960s when the more modern Knapp Memorial Hospital opened in the neighboring community of Weslaco. The building then served as a nursing home for several years before it was demolished to make way for the high rise senior apartment complex built in the late 1960s. [66]"
U029,5541,12,German Farm Family Out For A Sunday Buggy Drive,Homes,1916,"Here is a German family riding in a horse drawn buggy in front of their home. Developers advertised land near Mercedes in German newspapers. The ads attracted the attention of German farmers who bought and settled there in the early 1900s.  Their descendants continue to farm  in the area today. [17]

With its white porch columns, this home appears to be an Aladdin kit home ordered from a catalog and shipped via train from Michigan. Each kit came with a 75-page instruction book and thousands of pieces to be assembled upon arrival.  The Aladdin Company, founded 1908, was the first to manufacture kit homes, even before Sears & Roebuck. The homes were  popular in early Mercedes where materials such as cut lumber were not readily available.  This particular home appears to be the Cumberland Model featured in the 1915 Aladdin catalog.[39] [40]"

The Stokely Brothers had plants throughout the United States. Grapefruit originated as a natural hybrid between a Jamaican sweet orange and the Indonesian pomelo. In 1929 a Texas citrus grower discovered a mutated red grapefruit growing on a pink grapefruit tree, which became the Ruby Red variety. [1][24]

Stokely-Van Camp is the successor to Van Camp Packing Company, an Indianapolis packer founded in 1861, and Stokely Brothers and Company, a Newport, Tennessee, canning firm founded in 1898. The Stokely Brothers plant in Mercedes operated for 50 years, from about 1940 to 1990.  The old Power Plant building that it occuppied still stands  toda at the southwest corner of 2nd Street (old 83) and the Main Canal."
E009,5175,15,Jose de Escandón Mapped Land Grants of Area  That Later Became Mercedes,Ranch,1912," A ranch family drives their goat herd down an unpaved road in a mule-drawn buggy near area that became Mercedes. One side of the road landscape is natural and uncleared, suitable for ranching, while on the other side land is fenced and cleared for farmland and dotted by telephone poles. The image illustrates the transition from generations of traditional ranching and land ownership to the loss of heritage and land to large scale agricultural production.

Ranches sprouted and flourished in the mid-1700s because of Jose de Escandón, a Spaniard sent to the area by Spanish authorities in Mexico City.   According to Karen Fort, a local historian and co-author of Images of America: Hidalgo County, Texas, Escandón and other Spanish Land Grant families, mapped and settled the fertile region on both sides of the Rio Grande, then known as Seno Mexicano.

The theater is covered with film posters and signs advertising 'Home Made Ice Cream and Very Best Lemonade.' The Western Queen, another theater, is located to the right. According to a local newspaper from 1917, there was also another theater behind the camp, the Broadway, and that 'soldiers thronged the theaters each night from the time supper mess kits are cleaned until the bugle sends them home.'  At the time, only silent movies were available. The Western Queen accompanied the movies with music, which the soldiers enjoyed very much. [47]

Prohibition did not pass until several years after this photograph was taken, but there are no bars or signs for liquor or alcohol. It is possible that speakeasies existed but did not have signs to mark their presence."

The paved path through the park contrasts with the dirt streets. The American Hotel, which provided rooms and meals to thrifty travelers until it closed during the Great Depression, is located in the upper left corner. A closer look at the hotel balcony reveals a hammock hanging outside each room. 

The bushy palms on the right are native Sabal Palms. Once abundant in the Mercedes area, many stands were cleared or replaced by non-native palms by the turn of the century. Today, only about 100 acres of Sabal palms survive in Texas, most of them clustered in the Audubon Society's Sabal Palm Grove Sanctuary in Brownsville.[76]"

During the WWI period,  cavalry troops from Fort Brown camped in the park during joint training exercises. [82]

World War I was the last major conflict in which cavalry (horse) units were used extensively. Once considered essential offensive elements of a military force, the vulnerability of horses to modern weapons reduced their utility on the battlefield. [86]"
E010,5187,20,Mercedes Power Plant Generated Electricity from Steam,Infrastructure,1909,"The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company established the Mercedes Electric Company in 1908 to manage the power plant. In 1915, the company was sold to investors who installed a larger 100 horsepower engine and incorporated as the Mercedes Water, Light and Power Company.

The company was sold again in 1922 to the Valley Electric and Ice Company. Although they made many improvements, the plant could not meet the ever-increasing demand for electrical service. The plant ceased operations in 1924 when a Valley wide transmission network, or grid, made more reliable electricity available to Mercedes homes and businesses.

The architecture is similar to the Mercedes Hotel which was constructed concurrently by ARGLI in 1906.  Company president S.P. Silver occupied  it until his own home across the street was completed. The home was sold to Dr. Charles Buck and was known as the Buck House for many years. [23]

Colegio Jacinto Trevino, founded to advance the inclusion of Latino culture and history in Texas public school curriculum, occupied the building from 1969 to 1974.  The college name came from the song Corrido de Jacinto Treviño,   a border ballad about a hero who battles injustice. The college closed after 5 years due to internal disputes.

The lake on the ranch was originally called Tampacuaze Lake, after the Native Americans who lived there before the Spanish conquest. The lake was a resaca, a former channel of the Rio Grande River that had been cut off from the main river.  Eventually, it came to be called Campacuas Lake, and the ranch headquarters was located on the shore of the lake. The Cantú family also established a school, a chapel, and a cemetery on the ranch. [96]

Around 1914, the land was purchased by the American Land and Irrigation Company and leased to the private Campacuas Beach Club. Many events were held on the sandy beaches of the lake.

The city founders incorporated the town of Mercedes with the intention of establishing a strong economic center. To this end, they placed restrictions on building permits for Main Street and residential lots. Business structures were to be constructed of brick, stone, or concrete and cost at least 3,000 dollars and homes at least 2,000. These restrictions were intended to ensure that the town would be built to a high standard and would attract businesses and residents of means.[26]"

Llano Grande was the name given to the land when it was granted to Juan Jose Ynojosa de Balli  by the Spanish Crown in the late 18th Century. 'The area was once overed in grasslands - llano - and was large – grande.''[13]

In an interview with early resident Lorraine Kennedy, she recalled that her Grandfather, O.J. 'Red' Schaeffer, was a jitney driver at Camp Llano Grande. In 1918 the Mercedes City Council passed an ordinance making it illegal to speak German, or to use German in advertising, preaching, lecturing and entertaining.

The first city election installed the six council members. They are, left to right: John Puckett, Gouverneur K Watson, Mayor William Lingenbrink, Dr. Edward Schoonmaker, Fred Cutting, and Lyle Harrison. [27]

This postcard shows the new city council members sitting in Mercedes City Park smoking their cigars. All members are similarly dressed in the style of the day - jacket, vest and bowtie, heads topped by a bowler style hat.  For footwear, they wear knee high laced leather boots,  a necessity on the dusty, unpaved Mercedes roads.  Look closely to see the pistol at the feet of the council member on the far left.

If you look closely, you can see a gardener working on the palm trees in the lower right corner of the photo, and a woman and child crossing the sidewalk in the center of the photo.

Mercedes author and historian G.G. Garcia recalls that, having grown up on the side of town where homes had no lawns, 'The only green grass and landscaping I knew was at the city park and the old high school. Imagine growing up without lawn. First Street was caliche and gravel. Our front yards, such as they were, were of hard clay, great for playing marbles and tops, but not much more.' [92]"

It was one of several National Guard camps created under the National Defense Act to repel cross border raids led by Pancho Villa.  Soldiers from Indiana, Minnesota and North Dakota were stationed at the camp from 1916 - 1917.  The postcard depicts soldiers shaving and washing up at the water  spigot. Upon the onset or World War I,  the camp merged with Camp Mercedes to train soldiers for service in France. [13] [90]

Mercedes author and historian G.G. Garcia points out that the so called bandits or desperados were people fleeing the desolation and poverty of war in Mexico. They were men desperate for food and escape from terror. [92]"

The Mercedes Hotel Annex was constructed in 1912 and had hotel rooms on the upper floor and a library, barbershop, and drugstore on the first floor. The parapet in the center of the building is a nod to the Mission Revival style. The annex was renovated and renamed the Central Office Building in 1928. These buildings stood for over 50 years but were demolished by Urban Renewal in 1966. [62]  

'The Mercedes Commercial Club was organized in 1911 and was active in publicizing the town. That year also the Mercedes Public Library was founded. A new city charter was adopted in 1914, and by 1915 the population of the town was estimated to be 2,000.'[26]"

It took over five hundred men and three hundred mule teams to carve the canal from a stretch of land seven miles long between the Rio Grande River and the Mercedes Electric Power Station. [24]

According to an article published by the Development Corporation of Mercedes, 'The hard and back-breaking work of laborers who cleared the brush, dug the canals and its branches, made the drawings of the engineers come to life and form the basis of what for over 50 years would define the economy of Mercedes and the Rio Grande Valley.'

Many ranches had access to water from the Rio Grande River or one of the inland resacas (lakes). However, those that did not had to dig wells to provide fresh water for agriculture and household use. This water was often brackish and not suitable for drinking. 

As a result, vendors known as piperos filled barrels with fresh drinking water from good wells or the Rio Grande River and delivered it to homes using mule-drawn wagons. This was a vital service that ensured that people had access to clean water in the dry conditions. [28]"

It was located on Llano Grande Lake near Mercedes. The lake is now known as Progresso Lake and the Club House no longer stands.  The lake is actually a resaca, an arm of the Rio Grande River that became isolated when the river changed course.

The W.E. Stewart Land Company promotional brochure lured buyers with this exaggerated description: 'This is where the Stewart Land Co. entertain their excursions parties while in the Rio Grande Valley.

According to the card inscription, the market price for cabbage was $45 per ton at the time, and the shipping season was from February to April. The Rio Grande Valley had a year-round growing season, but transportation to Northern markets was limited because produce would spoil. Cabbage and onions, which could be transported long distances without refrigeration, were the first winter vegetable crops cultivated in the valley. Refrigerated rail cars became more widely available in the 1920s, and refrigerated trucks in the 1930s, allowing Mercedes farmers to produce and market a wider variety of fruits and vegetables.

Other early banks in Mercedes included Planters Bank and First National Bank. In 1928, Hidalgo County Bank moved to a new building that was constructed diagonally across the street in the empty lot seen here.

It is not clear what a tent party was in that era. Perhaps it was a garden party, or perhaps a party in one of the tents early Mercedes residents lived in since few hotels or houses were available.

The presence or absence of streetlights, as well as their style, can provide clues to the date of a photograph. Gas streetlights were used in the late 19th century, while electric street lights became available in the early 20th century.

Windows above the awnings of each building provided cross ventilation, which helped to keep the buildings cool as air conditioning was not then available.

In the early days, automobiles were sometimes parked in the middle of the street, rather than alongside the curb. This was because horses and buggies were still the primary mode of transportation, and hitches were embedded in the curbs to allow them to be tied up. As horses and buggies became less common, cars began to be parked at the curbs instead. This made more sense, as it allowed for more efficient use of space."

It is not known how many classrooms the school had, or whether there was a lunchroom. The school did have an auditorium used for school events. In addition, the local newspaper frequently announced civic organizations gathering at the school house auditorium, which must have been this auditorium, as no there were no others in Mercedes at the time.

The use of concrete allowed for the construction of larger and more complex canals than would have been possible with other materials. This, in turn, allowed for the irrigation of more land and the production of more crops. The use of concrete also made the canals more durable, which reduced the need for maintenance and repairs. The introduction of concrete  had a significant impact on the development of the lower Rio Grande Valley.

Before the arrival of the railroad in 1905, much of the livestock ranching trade in the American Southwest was with Mexico. This was because the interior United States markets were not accessible by transportation. Shipping products by sea was expensive and slow, so it was more efficient to trade with Mexico. The railroad made it possible to ship goods more quickly and cheaply to the interior United States, one of the many factors which led to a decline in the livestock ranching trade with Mexico."

Q002,5337,91,Many Mercedes Residents Worked For Texsun Juice Plant,Industry,1949,"This is an advertisement postcard for the Texsun Juice Company. The company produced juice from Valley citrus oranges and grapefruits from the 1930s until 1991. The citrus processing plant was located between Mercedes and Weslaco at one time.  Families living near the plant recall the ever-present scent of oranges and grapefruits being processed and the sound of boilers running 24 hours a day.

Texsun Juice Company was a major employer in the area until the late 1980s. In order to save money and increase profits, farmers began to grow less labor-intensive crops such as grain, cotton, and sugarcane instead of citrus. As a result of reduced citrus production, the company eventually closed."

Once the tree finally begins producing fruit, they about 6 months to ripen. The Texas citrus industry is mostly in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, with about 85 percent of the acreage in Hidalgo County. 

The major limiting factor in Texas citrus production is the risk of freeze damage.  Citrus fruits easily freeze at 26 to 28 degrees when these temperatures occur for several hours. The costs of replanting citrus orchards following a freeze are accentuated by the costs of recapturing markets lost to competing areas during freeze recovery.  [1][24]"
E013,5189,130,Rio Grande River Was Wider and Deeper Before Irrigation,Irrigation,1909,"From the mid-1700s to the early 1900s, steamboats transported passengers and goods on the Rio Grande River. As irrigation for large-scale agricultural production increased, the river volume decreased to such an extent that steamboat transportation became impracticable.  The last riverboat navigated the Rio Grande around 1909. [78]

Today more than 15 dams and diversions have reduced the river flow to a fraction of what it used to be.  The Rio Grande Regional Water Authority coordinates allocation of the river waters.

Laterals were built as needed to reach farmland as it was sold. The overall design and function of the irrigation system was inefficient because land was sold to farmers in scattered parcels wherever they wanted to buy it.

Concrete was used for many irrigation components such as pipes and drains at the beginning of the irrigation project, but canals were not fully lined with concrete until 1928. This greatly reduced water loss to seepage. Many of the original canals, both lined and unlined, are still in use today in Mercedes and the surrounding area.[24]"
